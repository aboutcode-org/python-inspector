Simply install it with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install certifi\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the\nbuilt-in function::\n\n    >>> import certifi\n\n    >>> certifi.where()\n    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'\n\nOr from the command line::\n\n    $ python -m certifi\n    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem\n\nEnjoy!\n\n.. _`Requests`: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/\n\nAddition/Removal of Certificates\n--------------------------------\n\nCertifi does not support any addition/removal or other modification of the\nCA trust store content.

      "description": "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\n=====================================================\n\nSupport for the Internationalised Domain Names in Applications\n(IDNA) protocol as specified in `RFC 5891 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_.\nThis is the latest version of the protocol and is sometimes referred to as\n\u201cIDNA 2008\u201d.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical Standard 46,\n`Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing <http://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the \u201cencodings.idna\u201d module that\ncomes with the Python standard library, but only supports the\nold, deprecated IDNA specification (`RFC 3490 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    # Python 3\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    \u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\n\n    # Python 2\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode(u'\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8')\n    'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah')\n    \u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\n\nPackages\n--------\n\nThe latest tagged release version is published in the PyPI repository:\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/idna.svg\n   :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/idna\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install this library, you can use pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install idna\n\nAlternatively, you can install the package using the bundled setup script:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nThis library works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 or later.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a domain\nname argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels respectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    # Python 3\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    \u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    # Python 2\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print u'\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430.\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435'.encode('idna')\n    xn--80ahd1agd.xn--80akhbyknj4f\n    >>> print 'xn--80ahd1agd.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna')\n    \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430.\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or ``alabel``\nfunctions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    # Python 2\n    >>> idna.alabel(u'\u6d4b\u8bd5')\n    'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the IDNA\nspecification no longer normalizes input from different potential ways a user\nmay input a domain name. This functionality, known as a \u201cmapping\u201d, is now\nconsidered by the specification to be a local user-interface issue distinct\nfrom IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping, that was developed by the Unicode\nConsortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing <http://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_,\nit provides for both a regular mapping for typical applications, as well as\na transitional mapping to help migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, \u201cK\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen\u201d is not a permissible label as *LATIN CAPITAL\nLETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general). UTS 46 will\nconvert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA conversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    # Python 3\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode(u'K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    k\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from the older\n2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the original IDNA\nspecification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (\u00df) was converted into two\n*LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current IDNA specification this\nconversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    # Python 2\n    >>> idna.encode(u'K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementors should use transitional processing with caution, only in rare\ncases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be performed\n(i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical applications\nthat just need to convert labels, transitional processing is unlikely to be\nbeneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible results.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the\nnew module name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification should\nraise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base class.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and right-to-left\ncharacters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when a specific codepoint is\nan illegal character in an IDN label (i.e. INVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext``\nwhen the codepoint is illegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO\nor CONTEXTJ but the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup tables for\nperformance. These tables are derived from computing against eligibility criteria\nin the respective standards. These tables are computed using the command-line\nscript ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant tables from the Unicode Consortium and perform the\nrequired calculations to identify eligibility. It has three main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py``,\n  the pre-calculated lookup tables using for IDNA and UTS 46 conversions. Implementors\n  who wish to track this library against a different Unicode version may use this tool\n  to manually generate a different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py``\n  files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix B.1 of RFC\n  5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA <http://iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various properties\n  associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this case, U+0061), that are\n  used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a codepoint. This is helpful in debugging\n  or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data -h``. Most notably,\nthe ``--version`` argument allows the specification of the version of Unicode to use\nin computing the table data. For example, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata``\nwill generate library data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\nNote that this script requires Python 3, but all generated library data will work\nin Python 2.7.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThe library has a test suite based on each rule of the IDNA specification, as\nwell as tests that are provided as part of the Unicode Technical Standard 46,\n`Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing <http://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThe tests are run automatically on each commit at Travis CI:\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/kjd/idna.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/kjd/idna",

Users who are using urllib3 version 1.17 or 1.18 along with\n  PyOpenSSL injection and OpenSSL 1.1.0 *must* upgrade to this version. This\n  release fixes a vulnerability whereby urllib3 in the above configuration\n  would silently fail to validate TLS certificates due to erroneously setting\n  invalid flags in OpenSSL's ``SSL_CTX_set_verify`` function. These erroneous\n  flags do not cause a problem in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0, which\n  interprets the presence of any flag as requesting certificate validation.\n\n  There is no PR for this patch, as it was prepared for simultaneous disclosure\n  and release.

(Issue #352)\n\n\n1.8 (2014-03-04)\n----------------\n\n* Improved url parsing in ``urllib3.util.parse_url`` (properly parse '@' in\n  username, and blank ports like 'hostname:').\n\n* New ``urllib3.connection`` module which contains all the HTTPConnection\n  objects.\n\n* Several ``urllib3.util.Timeout``-related fixes. Also changed constructor\n  signature to a more sensible order. [Backwards incompatible]\n  (Issues #252, #262, #263)\n\n* Use ``backports.ssl_match_hostname`` if it's installed. (Issue #274)\n\n* Added ``.tell()`` method to ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` which\n  returns the number of bytes read so far. (Issue #277)\n\n* Support for platforms without threading. (Issue #289)\n\n* Expand default-port comparison in ``HTTPConnectionPool.is_same_host``\n  to allow a pool with no specified port to be considered equal to to an\n  HTTP/HTTPS url with port 80/443 explicitly provided. (Issue #305)\n\n* Improved default SSL/TLS settings to avoid vulnerabilities.\n  (Issue #309)\n\n* Fixed ``urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager`` not retrying on connect errors.\n  (Issue #310)\n\n* Disable Nagle's Algorithm on the socket for non-proxies. A subset of requests\n  will send the entire HTTP request ~200 milliseconds faster; however, some of\n  the resulting TCP packets will be smaller. (Issue #254)\n\n* Increased maximum number of SubjectAltNames in ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl``\n  from the default 64 to 1024 in a single certificate. (Issue #318)\n\n* Headers are now passed and stored as a custom\n  ``urllib3.collections_.HTTPHeaderDict`` object rather than a plain ``dict``.\n  (Issue #329, #333)\n\n* Headers no longer lose their case on Python 3. (Issue #236)\n\n* ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` now uses the operating system's default CA\n  certificates on inject. (Issue #332)\n\n* Requests with ``retries=False`` will immediately raise any exceptions without\n  wrapping them in ``MaxRetryError``. (Issue #348)\n\n* Fixed open socket leak with SSL-related failures. (Issue #344, #348)\n\n\n1.7.1 (2013-09-25)\n------------------\n\n* Added granular timeout support with new ``urllib3.util.Timeout`` class.\n  (Issue #231)\n\n* Fixed Python 3.4 support. (Issue #238)\n\n\n1.7 (2013-08-14)\n----------------\n\n* More exceptions are now pickle-able, with tests. (Issue #174)\n\n* Fixed redirecting with relative URLs in Location header. (Issue #178)\n\n* Support for relative urls in ``Location: ...`` header. (Issue #179)\n\n* ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` now inherits from ``io.IOBase`` for bonus\n  file-like functionality. (Issue #187)\n\n* Passing ``assert_hostname=False`` when creating a HTTPSConnectionPool will\n  skip hostname verification for SSL connections. (Issue #194)\n\n* New method ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.stream(...)`` which acts as a\n  generator wrapped around ``.read(...)``. (Issue #198)\n\n* IPv6 url parsing enforces brackets around the hostname. (Issue #199)\n\n* Fixed thread race condition in\n  ``urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager.connection_from_host(...)`` (Issue #204)\n\n* ``ProxyManager`` requests now include non-default port in ``Host: ...``\n  header. (Issue #217)\n\n* Added HTTPS proxy support in ``ProxyManager``. (Issue #170 #139)\n\n* New ``RequestField`` object can be passed to the ``fields=...`` param which\n  can specify headers. (Issue #220)\n\n* Raise ``urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError`` when connecting to proxy fails.\n  (Issue #221)\n\n* Use international headers when posting file names. (Issue #119)\n\n* Improved IPv6 support. (Issue #203)\n\n\n1.6 (2013-04-25)\n----------------\n\n* Contrib: Optional SNI support for Py2 using PyOpenSSL. (Issue #156)\n\n* ``ProxyManager`` automatically adds ``Host: ...`` header if not given.\n\n* Improved SSL-related code. ``cert_req`` now optionally takes a string like\n  \"REQUIRED\" or \"NONE\". Same with ``ssl_version`` takes strings like \"SSLv23\"\n  The string values reflect the suffix of the respective constant variable.\n  (Issue #130)\n\n* Vendored ``socksipy`` now based on Anorov's fork which handles unexpectedly\n  closed proxy connections and larger read buffers. (Issue #135)\n\n* Ensure the connection is closed if no data is received, fixes connection leak\n  on some platforms. (Issue #133)\n\n* Added SNI support for SSL/TLS connections on Py32+. (Issue #89)\n\n* Tests fixed to be compatible with Py26 again. (Issue #125)\n\n* Added ability to choose SSL version by passing an ``ssl.PROTOCOL_*`` constant\n  to the ``ssl_version`` parameter of ``HTTPSConnectionPool``. (Issue #109)\n\n* Allow an explicit content type to be specified when encoding file fields.\n  (Issue #126)\n\n* Exceptions are now pickleable, with tests. (Issue #101)\n\n* Fixed default headers not getting passed in some cases. (Issue #99)\n\n* Treat \"content-encoding\" header value as case-insensitive, per RFC 2616\n  Section 3.5. (Issue #110)\n\n* \"Connection Refused\" SocketErrors will get retried rather than raised.\n  (Issue #92)\n\n* Updated vendored ``six``, no longer overrides the global ``six`` module\n  namespace. (Issue #113)\n\n* ``urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError`` contains a ``reason`` property holding\n  the exception that prompted the final retry. If ``reason is None`` then it\n  was due to a redirect. (Issue #92, #114)\n\n* Fixed ``PoolManager.urlopen()`` from not redirecting more than once.\n  (Issue #149)\n\n* Don't assume ``Content-Type: text/plain`` for multi-part encoding parameters\n  that are not files. (Issue #111)\n\n* Pass `strict` param down to ``httplib.HTTPConnection``. (Issue #122)\n\n* Added mechanism to verify SSL certificates by fingerprint (md5, sha1) or\n  against an arbitrary hostname (when connecting by IP or for misconfigured\n  servers). (Issue #140)\n\n* Streaming decompression support. (Issue #159)\n\n\n1.5 (2012-08-02)\n----------------\n\n* Added ``urllib3.add_stderr_logger()`` for quickly enabling STDERR debug\n  logging in urllib3.\n\n* Native full URL parsing (including auth, path, query, fragment) available in\n  ``urllib3.util.parse_url(url)``.\n\n* Built-in redirect will switch method to 'GET' if status code is 303.\n  (Issue #11)\n\n* ``urllib3.PoolManager`` strips the scheme and host before sending the request\n  uri. (Issue #8)\n\n* New ``urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`` exception for when automatic decoding,\n  based on the Content-Type header, fails.\n\n* Fixed bug with pool depletion and leaking connections (Issue #76). Added\n  explicit connection closing on pool eviction. Added\n  ``urllib3.PoolManager.clear()``.\n\n* 99% -> 100% unit test coverage.\n\n\n1.4 (2012-06-16)\n----------------\n\n* Minor AppEngine-related fixes.\n\n* Switched from ``mimetools.choose_boundary`` to ``uuid.uuid4()``.\n\n* Improved url parsing. (Issue #73)\n\n* IPv6 url support. (Issue #72)\n\n\n1.3 (2012-03-25)\n----------------\n\n* Removed pre-1.0 deprecated API.\n\n* Refactored helpers into a ``urllib3.util`` submodule.\n\n* Fixed multipart encoding to support list-of-tuples for keys with multiple\n  values. (Issue #48)\n\n* Fixed multiple Set-Cookie headers in response not getting merged properly in\n  Python 3. (Issue #53)\n\n* AppEngine support with Py27. (Issue #61)\n\n* Minor ``encode_multipart_formdata`` fixes related to Python 3 strings vs\n  bytes.\n\n\n1.2.2 (2012-02-06)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed packaging bug of not shipping ``test-requirements.txt``. (Issue #47)\n\n\n1.2.1 (2012-02-05)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed another bug related to when ``ssl`` module is not available. (Issue #41)\n\n* Location parsing errors now raise ``urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError``\n  which inherits from ``ValueError``.\n\n\n1.2 (2012-01-29)\n----------------\n\n* Added Python 3 support (tested on 3.2.2)\n\n* Dropped Python 2.5 support (tested on 2.6.7, 2.7.2)\n\n* Use ``select.poll`` instead of ``select.select`` for platforms that support\n  it.\n\n* Use ``Queue.LifoQueue`` instead of ``Queue.Queue`` for more aggressive\n  connection reusing. Configurable by overriding ``ConnectionPool.QueueCls``.\n\n* Fixed ``ImportError`` during install when ``ssl`` module is not available.\n  (Issue #41)\n\n* Fixed ``PoolManager`` redirects between schemes (such as HTTP -> HTTPS) not\n  completing properly. (Issue #28, uncovered by Issue #10 in v1.1)\n\n* Ported ``dummyserver`` to use ``tornado`` instead of ``webob`` +\n  ``eventlet``. Removed extraneous unsupported dummyserver testing backends.\n  Added socket-level tests.\n\n* More tests. Achievement Unlocked: 99% Coverage.\n\n\n1.1 (2012-01-07)\n----------------\n\n* Refactored ``dummyserver`` to its own root namespace module (used for\n  testing).\n\n* Added hostname verification for ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` by vendoring in\n  Py32's ``ssl_match_hostname``.

(Issue\n  #27)\n\n* Fixed timeout-related bugs. (Issues #17, #23)\n\n\n1.0.2 (2011-11-04)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed typo in ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` which would only present as a bug if\n  you're using the object manually. (Thanks pyos)\n\n* Made RecentlyUsedContainer (and consequently PoolManager) more thread-safe by\n  wrapping the access log in a mutex. (Thanks @christer)\n\n* Made RecentlyUsedContainer more dict-like (corrected ``__delitem__`` and\n  ``__getitem__`` behaviour), with tests. Shouldn't affect core urllib3 code.\n\n\n1.0.1 (2011-10-10)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed a bug where the same connection would get returned into the pool twice,\n  causing extraneous \"HttpConnectionPool is full\" log warnings.\n\n\n1.0 (2011-10-08)\n----------------\n\n* Added ``PoolManager`` with LRU expiration of connections (tested and\n  documented).\n* Added ``ProxyManager`` (needs tests, docs, and confirmation that it works\n  with HTTPS proxies).\n* Added optional partial-read support for responses when\n  ``preload_content=False``. You can now make requests and just read the headers\n  without loading the content.\n* Made response decoding optional (default on, same as before).\n* Added optional explicit boundary string for ``encode_multipart_formdata``.\n* Convenience request methods are now inherited from ``RequestMethods``. Old\n  helpers like ``get_url`` and ``post_url`` should be abandoned in favour of\n  the new ``request(method, url, ...)``.\n* Refactored code to be even more decoupled, reusable, and extendable.\n* License header added to ``.py`` files.\n* Embiggened the documentation: Lots of Sphinx-friendly docstrings in the code\n  and docs in ``docs/`` and on https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/.\n* Embettered all the things!\n* Started writing this file.\n\n\n0.4.1 (2011-07-17)\n------------------\n\n* Minor bug fixes, code cleanup.\n\n\n0.4 (2011-03-01)\n----------------\n\n* Better unicode support.\n* Added ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection``.\n* Added ``NTLMConnectionPool`` in contrib.\n* Minor improvements.\n\n\n0.3.1 (2010-07-13)\n------------------\n\n* Added ``assert_host_name`` optional parameter. Now compatible with proxies.\n\n\n0.3 (2009-12-10)\n----------------\n\n* Added HTTPS support.\n* Minor bug fixes.\n* Refactored, broken backwards compatibility with 0.2.\n* API to be treated as stable from this version forward.\n\n\n0.2 (2008-11-17)\n----------------\n\n* Added unit tests.\n* Bug fixes.\n\n\n0.1 (2008-11-16)\n----------------\n\n* First release.",
