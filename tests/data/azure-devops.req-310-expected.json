      "description": "Microsoft Azure Core Library for Python\n# Azure Core shared client library for Python\n\nAzure core provides shared exceptions and modules for Python SDK client libraries.\nThese libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) .\n\nIf you are a client library developer, please reference [client library developer reference](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md) for more information.\n\n[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/) \n| [Package (Pypi)][package]\n| [Package (Conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-core/)\n| [API reference documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/)\n\n## _Disclaimer_\n\n_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691>_\n\n## Getting started\n\nTypically, you will not need to install azure core;\nit will be installed when you install one of the client libraries using it.\nIn case you want to install it explicitly (to implement your own client library, for example),\nyou can find it [here](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/).\n\n## Key concepts\n\n### Azure Core Library Exceptions\n\n#### AzureError\n\nAzureError is the base exception for all errors.\n\n```python\nclass AzureError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.inner_exception = kwargs.get(\"error\")\n        self.exc_type, self.exc_value, self.exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()\n        self.exc_type = self.exc_type.__name__ if self.exc_type else type(self.inner_exception)\n        self.exc_msg = \"{}, {}: {}\".format(message, self.exc_type, self.exc_value)  # type: ignore\n        self.message = str(message)\n        self.continuation_token = kwargs.get(\"continuation_token\")\n        super(AzureError, self).__init__(self.message, *args)\n```\n\n*message* is any message (str) to be associated with the exception.\n\n*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.\n\n*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception. Use the keyword *error* to pass in an internal exception and *continuation_token* for a token reference to continue an incomplete operation.\n\n**The following exceptions inherit from AzureError:**\n\n#### ServiceRequestError\n\nAn error occurred while attempt to make a request to the service. No request was sent.\n\n#### ServiceResponseError\n\nThe request was sent, but the client failed to understand the response.\nThe connection may have timed out. These errors can be retried for idempotent or safe operations.\n\n#### HttpResponseError\n\nA request was made, and a non-success status code was received from the service.\n\n```python\nclass HttpResponseError(AzureError):\n    def __init__(self, message=None, response=None, **kwargs):\n        self.reason = None\n        self.response = response\n        if response:\n            self.reason = response.reason\n            self.status_code = response.status_code\n        self.error = self._parse_odata_body(ODataV4Format, response)  # type: Optional[ODataV4Format]\n        if self.error:\n            message = str(self.error)\n        else:\n            message = message or \"Operation returned an invalid status '{}'\".format(\n                self.reason\n            )\n\n        super(HttpResponseError, self).__init__(message=message, **kwargs)\n```\n\n*message* is the HTTP response error message (optional)\n\n*response* is the HTTP response (optional).\n\n*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.\n\n**The following exceptions inherit from HttpResponseError:**\n\n#### DecodeError\n\nAn error raised during response de-serialization.\n\n#### IncompleteReadError\n\nAn error raised if peer closes the connection before we have received the complete message body.\n\n#### ResourceExistsError\n\nAn error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### ResourceNotFoundError\n\nAn error response, typically triggered by a 412 response (for update) or 404 (for get/post).\n\n#### ResourceModifiedError\n\nAn error response with status code 4xx, typically 412 Conflict. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### ResourceNotModifiedError\n\nAn error response with status code 304. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### ClientAuthenticationError\n\nAn error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### TooManyRedirectsError\n\nAn error raised when the maximum number of redirect attempts is reached. The maximum amount of redirects can be configured in the RedirectPolicy.\n\n```python\nclass TooManyRedirectsError(HttpResponseError):\n    def __init__(self, history, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.history = history\n        message = \"Reached maximum redirect attempts.\"\n        super(TooManyRedirectsError, self).__init__(message, *args, **kwargs)\n```\n\n*history* is used to document the requests/responses that resulted in redirected requests.\n\n*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.\n\n*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.\n\n#### StreamConsumedError\n\nAn error thrown if you try to access the stream of `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` once\nthe response stream has been consumed.\n\n#### StreamClosedError\n\nAn error thrown if you try to access the stream of the `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` once\nthe response stream has been closed.\n\n#### ResponseNotReadError\n\nAn error thrown if you try to access the `content` of `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` before\nreading in the response's bytes first.\n\n### Configurations\n\nWhen calling the methods, some properties can be configured by passing in as kwargs arguments.\n\n| Parameters | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| headers | The HTTP Request headers. |\n| request_id | The request id to be added into header. |\n| user_agent | If specified, this will be added in front of the user agent string. |\n| logging_enable| Use to enable per operation. Defaults to `False`. |\n| logger | If specified, it will be used to log information. |\n| response_encoding | The encoding to use if known for this service (will disable auto-detection). |\n| proxies | Maps protocol or protocol and hostname to the URL of the proxy. |\n| raw_request_hook | Callback function. Will be invoked on request. |\n| raw_response_hook | Callback function. Will be invoked on response. |\n| network_span_namer | A callable to customize the span name. |\n| tracing_attributes | Attributes to set on all created spans. |\n| permit_redirects | Whether the client allows redirects. Defaults to `True`. |\n| redirect_max | The maximum allowed redirects. Defaults to `30`. |\n| retry_total | Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts. Default value is `10`. |\n| retry_connect | How many connection-related errors to retry on. These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server, which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request. Default value is `3`. |\n| retry_read | How many times to retry on read errors. These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the request may have side-effects. Default value is `3`. |\n| retry_status | How many times to retry on bad status codes. Default value is `3`. |\n| retry_backoff_factor | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay). Retry policy will sleep for: `{backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries} - 1))` seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then the retry will sleep for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. The default value is `0.8`. |\n| retry_backoff_max | The maximum back off time. Default value is `120` seconds (2 minutes). |\n| retry_mode | Fixed or exponential delay between attempts, default is `Exponential`. |\n| timeout | Timeout setting for the operation in seconds, default is `604800`s (7 days). |\n| connection_timeout | A single float in seconds for the connection timeout. Defaults to `300` seconds. |\n| read_timeout | A single float in seconds for the read timeout. Defaults to `300` seconds. |\n| connection_verify | SSL certificate verification. Enabled by default. Set to False to disable, alternatively can be set to the path to a CA_BUNDLE file or directory with certificates of trusted CAs. |\n| connection_cert | Client-side certificates. You can specify a local cert to use as client side certificate, as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate) or as a tuple of both files' paths. |\n| proxies | Dictionary mapping protocol or protocol and hostname to the URL of the proxy. |\n| cookies | Dict or CookieJar object to send with the `Request`. |\n| connection_data_block_size | The block size of data sent over the connection. Defaults to `4096` bytes. |\n\n### Async transport\n\nThe async transport is designed to be opt-in. [AioHttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) is one of the supported implementations of async transport. It is not installed by default. You need to install it separately.\n\n### Shared modules\n\n#### MatchConditions\n\nMatchConditions is an enum to describe match conditions.\n\n```python\nclass MatchConditions(Enum):\n    Unconditionally = 1  # Matches any condition\n    IfNotModified = 2  # If the target object is not modified. Usually it maps to etag=<specific etag>\n    IfModified = 3  # Only if the target object is modified. Usually it maps to etag!=<specific etag>\n    IfPresent = 4   # If the target object exists. Usually it maps to etag='*'\n    IfMissing = 5   # If the target object does not exist. Usually it maps to etag!='*'\n```\n\n#### CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta\n\nA metaclass to support case-insensitive enums.\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom azure.core import CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta\n\nclass MyCustomEnum(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):\n    FOO = 'foo'\n    BAR = 'bar'\n```\n\n#### Null Sentinel Value\n\nA falsy sentinel object which is supposed to be used to specify attributes\nwith no data. This gets serialized to `null` on the wire.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.core.serialization import NULL\n\nassert bool(NULL) is False\n\nfoo = Foo(\n    attr=NULL\n)\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

They should not be initialized directly, instead\nyour transport responses should inherit from them and implement them.\n- The properties of the `azure.core.rest` responses are now all read-only\n\n- HttpLoggingPolicy integrates logs into one record #19925\n\n## 1.18.0 (2021-09-02)\n\n### Features Added\n\n- `azure.core.serialization.AzureJSONEncoder` (introduced in 1.17.0) serializes `datetime.datetime` objects in ISO 8601 format, conforming to RFC 3339's specification.    #20190\n- We now use `azure.core.serialization.AzureJSONEncoder` to serialize `json` input to `azure.core.rest.HttpRequest`.\n\n### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package\n\n- The `text` property on `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` has changed to a method, which also takes\nan `encoding` parameter.\n- Removed `iter_text` and `iter_lines` from `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse`\n\n### Bugs Fixed\n\n- The behaviour of the headers returned in `azure.core.rest` responses now aligns across sync and async. Items can now be checked case-insensitively and without raising an error for format.\n\n## 1.17.0 (2021-08-05)\n\n### Features Added\n\n- Cut hard dependency on requests library\n- Added a `from_json` method which now accepts storage QueueMessage, eventhub's EventData or ServiceBusMessage or simply json bytes to return a `CloudEvent`\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Not override \"x-ms-client-request-id\" if it already exists in the header.    #17757\n\n### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package\n\n- `azure.core.rest` will not try to guess the `charset` anymore if it was impossible to extract it from `HttpResponse` analysis. This removes our dependency on `charset`.\n\n## 1.16.0 (2021-07-01)\n\n### Features Added\n\n- Add new ***provisional*** methods `send_request` onto the `azure.core.PipelineClient` and `azure.core.AsyncPipelineClient`. This method takes in\nrequests and sends them through our pipelines.\n- Add new ***provisional*** module `azure.core.rest`. `azure.core.rest` is our new public simple HTTP library in `azure.core` that users will use to create requests, and consume responses.\n- Add new ***provisional*** errors `StreamConsumedError`, `StreamClosedError`, and `ResponseNotReadError` to `azure.core.exceptions`. These errors\nare thrown if you mishandle streamed responses from the provisional `azure.core.rest` module\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Improved error message in the `from_dict` method of `CloudEvent` when a wrong schema is sent.\n\n## 1.15.0 (2021-06-04)\n\n### New Features\n\n- Added `BearerTokenCredentialPolicy.on_challenge` and `.authorize_request` to allow subclasses to optionally handle authentication challenges\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Retry policies don't sleep after operations time out\n- The `from_dict` methhod in the `CloudEvent` can now convert a datetime string to datetime object when microsecond exceeds the python limitation\n\n## 1.14.0 (2021-05-13)\n\n### New Features\n\n- Added `azure.core.credentials.AzureNamedKeyCredential` credential #17548.\n- Added `decompress` parameter for `stream_download` method. If it is set to `False`, will not do decompression upon the stream.    #17920\n\n## 1.13.0 (2021-04-02)\n\nAzure core requires Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+ since this release.\n\n### New Features\n\n- Added `azure.core.utils.parse_connection_string` function to parse connection strings across SDKs, with common validation and support for case insensitive keys.\n- Supported adding custom policies  #16519\n- Added `~azure.core.tracing.Link` that should be used while passing `Links` to  `AbstractSpan`.\n- `AbstractSpan` constructor can now take in additional keyword only args.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Make NetworkTraceLoggingPolicy show the auth token in plain text. #14191\n- Fixed RetryPolicy overriding default connection timeout with an extreme value #17481\n\n## 1.12.0 (2021-03-08)\n\nThis version will be the last version to officially support Python 3.5, future versions will require Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+.\n\n### Features\n\n- Added `azure.core.messaging.CloudEvent` model that follows the cloud event spec.\n- Added `azure.core.serialization.NULL` sentinel value\n- Improve `repr`s for `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse`s  #16972\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Disable retry in stream downloading. (thanks to @jochen-ott-by @hoffmann for the contribution)  #16723\n\n## 1.11.0 (2021-02-08)\n\n### Features\n\n- Added `CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta` class for case-insensitive enums.  #16316\n- Add `raise_for_status` method onto `HttpResponse`. Calling `response.raise_for_status()` on a response with an error code\nwill raise an `HttpResponseError`. Calling it on a good response will do nothing  #16399\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Update conn.conn_kw rather than overriding it when setting block size. (thanks for @jiasli for the contribution)  #16587\n\n## 1.10.0 (2021-01-11)\n\n### Features\n\n- Added `AzureSasCredential` and its respective policy. #15946\n\n## 1.9.0 (2020-11-09)\n\n### Features\n\n- Add a `continuation_token` attribute to the base `AzureError` exception, and set this value for errors raised\n  during paged or long-running operations.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Set retry_interval to 1 second instead of 1000 seconds (thanks **vbarbaresi** for contributing)  #14357\n\n\n## 1.8.2 (2020-10-05)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed bug to allow polling in the case of parameterized endpoints with relative polling urls  #14097\n\n\n## 1.8.1 (2020-09-08)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- SAS credential replicated \"/\" fix #13159\n\n## 1.8.0 (2020-08-10)\n\n### Features\n\n- Support params as list for exploding parameters  #12410\n\n\n## 1.7.0 (2020-07-06)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- `AzureKeyCredentialPolicy` will now accept (and ignore) passed in kwargs  #11963\n- Better error messages if passed endpoint is incorrect  #12106\n- Do not JSON encore a string if content type is \"text\"  #12137\n\n### Features\n\n- Added `http_logging_policy` property on the `Configuration` object, allowing users to individually\nset the http logging policy of the config  #12218\n\n## 1.6.0 (2020-06-03)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed deadlocks in AsyncBearerTokenCredentialPolicy #11543\n- Fix AttributeException in StreamDownloadGenerator #11462\n\n### Features\n\n- Added support for changesets as part of multipart message support #10485\n- Add AsyncLROPoller in azure.core.polling #10801\n- Add get_continuation_token/from_continuation_token/polling_method methods in pollers (sync and async) #10801\n- HttpResponse and PipelineContext objects are now pickable #10801\n\n## 1.5.0 (2020-05-04)\n\n### Features\n\n- Support \"x-ms-retry-after-ms\" in response header   #10743\n- `link` and `link_from_headers` now accepts attributes   #10765\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Not retry if the status code is less than 400 #10778\n- \"x-ms-request-id\" is not considered safe header for logging #10967\n\n## 1.4.0 (2020-04-06)\n\n### Features\n\n- Support a default error type in map_error #9773\n- Added `AzureKeyCredential` and its respective policy. #10509\n- Added `azure.core.polling.base_polling` module with a \"Microsoft One API\" polling implementation #10090\n  Also contains the async version in `azure.core.polling.async_base_polling`\n- Support kwarg `enforce_https` to disable HTTPS check on authentication #9821\n- Support additional kwargs in `HttpRequest.set_multipart_mixed` that will be passed into pipeline context.\n\n## 1.3.0 (2020-03-09)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Appended RequestIdPolicy to the default pipeline  #9841\n- Rewind the body position in async_retry   #10117\n\n### Features\n\n- Add raw_request_hook support in custom_hook_policy   #9958\n- Add timeout support in retry_policy   #10011\n- Add OdataV4 error format auto-parsing in all exceptions ('error' attribute)  #9738\n\n## 1.2.2 (2020-02-10)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed a bug that sends None as request_id #9545\n- Enable mypy for customers #9572\n- Handle TypeError in deep copy #9620\n- Fix text/plain content-type in decoder #9589\n\n## 1.2.1 (2020-01-14)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed a regression in 1.2.0 that was incompatible with azure-keyvault-* 4.0.0\n[#9462](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/9462)\n\n\n## 1.2.0 (2020-01-14)\n\n### Features\n\n- Add user_agent & sdk_moniker kwargs in UserAgentPolicy init   #9355\n- Support OPTIONS HTTP verb     #9322\n- Add tracing_attributes to tracing decorator   #9297\n- Support auto_request_id in RequestIdPolicy   #9163\n- Support fixed retry   #6419\n- Support \"retry-after-ms\" in response header   #9240\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Removed `__enter__` and `__exit__` from async context managers    #9313\n\n## 1.1.1 (2019-12-03)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Bearer token authorization requires HTTPS\n- Rewind the body position in retry #8307\n\n## 1.1.0 (2019-11-25)\n\n### Features\n\n- New RequestIdPolicy   #8437\n- Enable logging policy in default pipeline #8053\n- Normalize transport timeout.   #8000\n  Now we have:\n  * 'connection_timeout' - a single float in seconds for the connection timeout.

      "description": "Microsoft Azure Core Library for Python\n# Azure Core shared client library for Python\n\nAzure core provides shared exceptions and modules for Python SDK client libraries.\nThese libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) .\n\nIf you are a client library developer, please reference [client library developer reference](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md) for more information.\n\n[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/) \n| [Package (Pypi)][package]\n| [Package (Conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-core/)\n| [API reference documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/)\n\n## _Disclaimer_\n\n_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691>_\n\n## Getting started\n\nTypically, you will not need to install azure core;\nit will be installed when you install one of the client libraries using it.\nIn case you want to install it explicitly (to implement your own client library, for example),\nyou can find it [here](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/).\n\n## Key concepts\n\n### Azure Core Library Exceptions\n\n#### AzureError\n\nAzureError is the base exception for all errors.\n\n```python\nclass AzureError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.inner_exception = kwargs.get(\"error\")\n        self.exc_type, self.exc_value, self.exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()\n        self.exc_type = self.exc_type.__name__ if self.exc_type else type(self.inner_exception)\n        self.exc_msg = \"{}, {}: {}\".format(message, self.exc_type, self.exc_value)  # type: ignore\n        self.message = str(message)\n        self.continuation_token = kwargs.get(\"continuation_token\")\n        super(AzureError, self).__init__(self.message, *args)\n```\n\n*message* is any message (str) to be associated with the exception.\n\n*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.\n\n*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception. Use the keyword *error* to pass in an internal exception and *continuation_token* for a token reference to continue an incomplete operation.\n\n**The following exceptions inherit from AzureError:**\n\n#### ServiceRequestError\n\nAn error occurred while attempt to make a request to the service. No request was sent.\n\n#### ServiceResponseError\n\nThe request was sent, but the client failed to understand the response.\nThe connection may have timed out. These errors can be retried for idempotent or safe operations.\n\n#### HttpResponseError\n\nA request was made, and a non-success status code was received from the service.\n\n```python\nclass HttpResponseError(AzureError):\n    def __init__(self, message=None, response=None, **kwargs):\n        self.reason = None\n        self.response = response\n        if response:\n            self.reason = response.reason\n            self.status_code = response.status_code\n        self.error = self._parse_odata_body(ODataV4Format, response)  # type: Optional[ODataV4Format]\n        if self.error:\n            message = str(self.error)\n        else:\n            message = message or \"Operation returned an invalid status '{}'\".format(\n                self.reason\n            )\n\n        super(HttpResponseError, self).__init__(message=message, **kwargs)\n```\n\n*message* is the HTTP response error message (optional)\n\n*response* is the HTTP response (optional).\n\n*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.\n\n**The following exceptions inherit from HttpResponseError:**\n\n#### DecodeError\n\nAn error raised during response de-serialization.\n\n#### IncompleteReadError\n\nAn error raised if peer closes the connection before we have received the complete message body.\n\n#### ResourceExistsError\n\nAn error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### ResourceNotFoundError\n\nAn error response, typically triggered by a 412 response (for update) or 404 (for get/post).\n\n#### ResourceModifiedError\n\nAn error response with status code 4xx, typically 412 Conflict. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### ResourceNotModifiedError\n\nAn error response with status code 304. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### ClientAuthenticationError\n\nAn error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.\n\n#### TooManyRedirectsError\n\nAn error raised when the maximum number of redirect attempts is reached. The maximum amount of redirects can be configured in the RedirectPolicy.\n\n```python\nclass TooManyRedirectsError(HttpResponseError):\n    def __init__(self, history, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.history = history\n        message = \"Reached maximum redirect attempts.\"\n        super(TooManyRedirectsError, self).__init__(message, *args, **kwargs)\n```\n\n*history* is used to document the requests/responses that resulted in redirected requests.\n\n*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.\n\n*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.\n\n#### StreamConsumedError\n\nAn error thrown if you try to access the stream of `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` once\nthe response stream has been consumed.\n\n#### StreamClosedError\n\nAn error thrown if you try to access the stream of the `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` once\nthe response stream has been closed.\n\n#### ResponseNotReadError\n\nAn error thrown if you try to access the `content` of `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` before\nreading in the response's bytes first.\n\n### Configurations\n\nWhen calling the methods, some properties can be configured by passing in as kwargs arguments.\n\n| Parameters | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| headers | The HTTP Request headers. |\n| request_id | The request id to be added into header. |\n| user_agent | If specified, this will be added in front of the user agent string. |\n| logging_enable| Use to enable per operation. Defaults to `False`. |\n| logger | If specified, it will be used to log information. |\n| response_encoding | The encoding to use if known for this service (will disable auto-detection). |\n| proxies | Maps protocol or protocol and hostname to the URL of the proxy. |\n| raw_request_hook | Callback function. Will be invoked on request. |\n| raw_response_hook | Callback function. Will be invoked on response. |\n| network_span_namer | A callable to customize the span name. |\n| tracing_attributes | Attributes to set on all created spans. |\n| permit_redirects | Whether the client allows redirects. Defaults to `True`. |\n| redirect_max | The maximum allowed redirects. Defaults to `30`. |\n| retry_total | Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts. Default value is `10`. |\n| retry_connect | How many connection-related errors to retry on. These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server, which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request. Default value is `3`. |\n| retry_read | How many times to retry on read errors. These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the request may have side-effects. Default value is `3`. |\n| retry_status | How many times to retry on bad status codes. Default value is `3`. |\n| retry_backoff_factor | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay). Retry policy will sleep for: `{backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries} - 1))` seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then the retry will sleep for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. The default value is `0.8`. |\n| retry_backoff_max | The maximum back off time. Default value is `120` seconds (2 minutes). |\n| retry_mode | Fixed or exponential delay between attempts, default is `Exponential`. |\n| timeout | Timeout setting for the operation in seconds, default is `604800`s (7 days). |\n| connection_timeout | A single float in seconds for the connection timeout. Defaults to `300` seconds. |\n| read_timeout | A single float in seconds for the read timeout. Defaults to `300` seconds. |\n| connection_verify | SSL certificate verification. Enabled by default. Set to False to disable, alternatively can be set to the path to a CA_BUNDLE file or directory with certificates of trusted CAs. |\n| connection_cert | Client-side certificates. You can specify a local cert to use as client side certificate, as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate) or as a tuple of both files' paths. |\n| proxies | Dictionary mapping protocol or protocol and hostname to the URL of the proxy. |\n| cookies | Dict or CookieJar object to send with the `Request`. |\n| connection_data_block_size | The block size of data sent over the connection. Defaults to `4096` bytes. |\n\n### Async transport\n\nThe async transport is designed to be opt-in. [AioHttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) is one of the supported implementations of async transport. It is not installed by default. You need to install it separately.\n\n### Shared modules\n\n#### MatchConditions\n\nMatchConditions is an enum to describe match conditions.\n\n```python\nclass MatchConditions(Enum):\n    Unconditionally = 1  # Matches any condition\n    IfNotModified = 2  # If the target object is not modified. Usually it maps to etag=<specific etag>\n    IfModified = 3  # Only if the target object is modified. Usually it maps to etag!=<specific etag>\n    IfPresent = 4   # If the target object exists. Usually it maps to etag='*'\n    IfMissing = 5   # If the target object does not exist. Usually it maps to etag!='*'\n```\n\n#### CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta\n\nA metaclass to support case-insensitive enums.\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom azure.core import CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta\n\nclass MyCustomEnum(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):\n    FOO = 'foo'\n    BAR = 'bar'\n```\n\n#### Null Sentinel Value\n\nA falsy sentinel object which is supposed to be used to specify attributes\nwith no data. This gets serialized to `null` on the wire.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.core.serialization import NULL\n\nassert bool(NULL) is False\n\nfoo = Foo(\n    attr=NULL\n)\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

Items can now be checked case-insensitively and without raising an error for format.\n\n## 1.17.0 (2021-08-05)\n\n### Features Added\n\n- Cut hard dependency on requests library\n- Added a `from_json` method which now accepts storage QueueMessage, eventhub's EventData or ServiceBusMessage or simply json bytes to return a `CloudEvent`\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Not override \"x-ms-client-request-id\" if it already exists in the header.    #17757\n\n### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package\n\n- `azure.core.rest` will not try to guess the `charset` anymore if it was impossible to extract it from `HttpResponse` analysis. This removes our dependency on `charset`.\n\n## 1.16.0 (2021-07-01)\n\n### Features Added\n\n- Add new ***provisional*** methods `send_request` onto the `azure.core.PipelineClient` and `azure.core.AsyncPipelineClient`. This method takes in\nrequests and sends them through our pipelines.\n- Add new ***provisional*** module `azure.core.rest`. `azure.core.rest` is our new public simple HTTP library in `azure.core` that users will use to create requests, and consume responses.\n- Add new ***provisional*** errors `StreamConsumedError`, `StreamClosedError`, and `ResponseNotReadError` to `azure.core.exceptions`. These errors\nare thrown if you mishandle streamed responses from the provisional `azure.core.rest` module\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Improved error message in the `from_dict` method of `CloudEvent` when a wrong schema is sent.\n\n## 1.15.0 (2021-06-04)\n\n### New Features\n\n- Added `BearerTokenCredentialPolicy.on_challenge` and `.authorize_request` to allow subclasses to optionally handle authentication challenges\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Retry policies don't sleep after operations time out\n- The `from_dict` methhod in the `CloudEvent` can now convert a datetime string to datetime object when microsecond exceeds the python limitation\n\n## 1.14.0 (2021-05-13)\n\n### New Features\n\n- Added `azure.core.credentials.AzureNamedKeyCredential` credential #17548.\n- Added `decompress` parameter for `stream_download` method. If it is set to `False`, will not do decompression upon the stream.    #17920\n\n## 1.13.0 (2021-04-02)\n\nAzure core requires Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+ since this release.\n\n### New Features\n\n- Added `azure.core.utils.parse_connection_string` function to parse connection strings across SDKs, with common validation and support for case insensitive keys.\n- Supported adding custom policies  #16519\n- Added `~azure.core.tracing.Link` that should be used while passing `Links` to  `AbstractSpan`.\n- `AbstractSpan` constructor can now take in additional keyword only args.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Make NetworkTraceLoggingPolicy show the auth token in plain text. #14191\n- Fixed RetryPolicy overriding default connection timeout with an extreme value #17481\n\n## 1.12.0 (2021-03-08)\n\nThis version will be the last version to officially support Python 3.5, future versions will require Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+.\n\n### Features\n\n- Added `azure.core.messaging.CloudEvent` model that follows the cloud event spec.\n- Added `azure.core.serialization.NULL` sentinel value\n- Improve `repr`s for `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse`s  #16972\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Disable retry in stream downloading.

Calling `response.raise_for_status()` on a response with an error code\nwill raise an `HttpResponseError`. Calling it on a good response will do nothing  #16399\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Update conn.conn_kw rather than overriding it when setting block size.

      "description": "Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Client Library for Python\n# Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python\nAzure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.\n\nBlob storage is ideal for:\n\n* Serving images or documents directly to a browser\n* Storing files for distributed access\n* Streaming video and audio\n* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving\n* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service\n\n[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/azure/storage/blob) | [Package (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-blob/) | [API reference documentation](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-ref) | [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples)\n\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n* Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please read our page on [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).\n* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an\n[Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) to use this package.\n\n### Install the package\nInstall the Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):\n\n```bash\npip install azure-storage-blob\n```\n\n### Create a storage account\nIf you wish to create a new storage account, you can use the\n[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal),\n[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-powershell),\nor [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-cli):\n\n```bash\n# Create a new resource group to hold the storage account -\n# if using an existing resource group, skip this step\naz group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2\n\n# Create the storage account\naz storage account create -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group\n```\n\n### Create the client\nThe Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python allows you to interact with three types of resources: the storage\naccount itself, blob storage containers, and blobs. Interaction with these resources starts with an instance of a\n[client](#clients). To create a client object, you will need the storage account's blob service account URL and a\ncredential that allows you to access the storage account:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n\nservice = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/\", credential=credential)\n```\n\n#### Looking up the account URL\nYou can find the storage account's blob service URL using the\n[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#storage-account-endpoints),\n[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccount),\nor [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-account-show):\n\n```bash\n# Get the blob service account url for the storage account\naz storage account show -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group --query \"primaryEndpoints.blob\"\n```\n\n#### Types of credentials\nThe `credential` parameter may be provided in a number of different forms, depending on the type of\n[authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth) you wish to use:\n1. To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad),\n   provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the\n   [azure-identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#credentials) library.\n   For example, [DefaultAzureCredential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#defaultazurecredential)\n   can be used to authenticate the client.\n\n   This requires some initial setup:\n   * [Install azure-identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#install-the-package)\n   * [Register a new AAD application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) and give permissions to access Azure Storage\n   * [Grant access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal) to Azure Blob data with RBAC in the Azure Portal\n   * Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:\n     AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET\n\n   Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:\n    ```python\n        from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n        from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n        token_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n        blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(\n            account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\",\n            credential=token_credential\n        )\n    ```\n\n2. To use a [shared access signature (SAS) token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview),\n   provide the token as a string. If your account URL includes the SAS token, omit the credential parameter.\n   You can generate a SAS token from the Azure Portal under \"Shared access signature\" or use one of the `generate_sas()`\n   functions to create a sas token for the storage account, container, or blob:\n\n    ```python\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, generate_account_sas, ResourceTypes, AccountSasPermissions\n\n    sas_token = generate_account_sas(\n        account_name=\"<storage-account-name>\",\n        account_key=\"<account-access-key>\",\n        resource_types=ResourceTypes(service=True),\n        permission=AccountSasPermissions(read=True),\n        expiry=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)\n    )\n\n    blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\", credential=sas_token)\n    ```\n\n3. To use a storage account [shared key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/authenticate-with-shared-key/)\n   (aka account key or access key), provide the key as a string. This can be found in the Azure Portal under the \"Access Keys\"\n   section or by running the following Azure CLI command:\n\n    ```az storage account keys list -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount```\n\n    Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:\n    ```python\n    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n    service = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\", credential=\"<account_access_key>\")\n    ```\n    \n    If you are using **customized url** (which means the url is not in this format `<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net`),\n    please instantiate the client using the credential below:\n    ```python\n    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n    service = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\", \n       credential={\"account_name\": \"<your_account_name>\", \"account_key\":\"<account_access_key>\"})\n    ```\n\n4. To use [anonymous public read access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-manage-access-to-resources),\n   simply omit the credential parameter.\n\n#### Creating the client from a connection string\nDepending on your use case and authorization method, you may prefer to initialize a client instance with a storage\nconnection string instead of providing the account URL and credential separately. To do this, pass the storage\nconnection string to the client's `from_connection_string` class method:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n\nconnection_string = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=xxxx;AccountKey=xxxx;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net\"\nservice = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=connection_string)\n```\n\nThe connection string to your storage account can be found in the Azure Portal under the \"Access Keys\" section or by running the following CLI command:\n\n```bash\naz storage account show-connection-string -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount\n```\n\n## Key concepts\nThe following components make up the Azure Blob Service:\n* The storage account itself\n* A container within the storage account\n* A blob within a container\n\nThe Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python allows you to interact with each of these components through the\nuse of a dedicated client object.\n\n### Clients\nFour different clients are provided to interact with the various components of the Blob Service:\n1. [BlobServiceClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-blobserviceclient) -\n    this client represents interaction with the Azure storage account itself, and allows you to acquire preconfigured\n    client instances to access the containers and blobs within. It provides operations to retrieve and configure the\n    account properties as well as list, create, and delete containers within the account. To perform operations on a\n    specific container or blob, retrieve a client using the `get_container_client` or `get_blob_client` methods.\n2. [ContainerClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-containerclient) -\n    this client represents interaction with a specific container (which need not exist yet), and allows you to acquire\n    preconfigured client instances to access the blobs within. It provides operations to create, delete, or configure a\n    container and includes operations to list, upload, and delete the blobs within it. To perform operations on a\n    specific blob within the container, retrieve a client using the `get_blob_client` method.\n3. [BlobClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-blobclient) -\n    this client represents interaction with a specific blob (which need not exist yet). It provides operations to\n    upload, download, delete, and create snapshots of a blob, as well as specific operations per blob type.\n4. [BlobLeaseClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-blobleaseclient) -\n    this client represents lease interactions with a `ContainerClient` or `BlobClient`. It provides operations to\n    acquire, renew, release, change, and break a lease on a specified resource.\n\n### Async Clients \nThis library includes a complete async API supported on Python 3.5+. To use it, you must\nfirst install an async transport, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/).\nSee\n[azure-core documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#transport)\nfor more information.\n\nAsync clients and credentials should be closed when they're no longer needed. These\nobjects are async context managers and define async `close` methods.\n\n### Blob Types\nOnce you've initialized a Client, you can choose from the different types of blobs:\n* [Block blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-block-blobs)\n  store text and binary data, up to approximately 4.75 TiB. Block blobs are made up of blocks of data that can be\n  managed individually\n* [Append blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-append-blobs)\n  are made up of blocks like block blobs, but are optimized for append operations. Append blobs are ideal for scenarios\n  such as logging data from virtual machines\n* [Page blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-page-blobs)\n  store random access files up to 8 TiB in size. Page blobs store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for\n  Azure virtual machines\n\n## Examples\nThe following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Storage Blob tasks, including:\n\n* [Create a container](#create-a-container \"Create a container\")\n* [Uploading a blob](#uploading-a-blob \"Uploading a blob\")\n* [Downloading a blob](#downloading-a-blob \"Downloading a blob\")\n* [Enumerating blobs](#enumerating-blobs \"Enumerating blobs\")\n\nNote that a container must be created before to upload or download a blob.\n\n### Create a container\n\nCreate a container from where you can upload or download blobs.\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer_client = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\ncontainer_client.create_container()\n```\n\nUse the async client to upload a blob\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer_client = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\nawait container_client.create_container()\n```\n\n### Uploading a blob\nUpload a blob to your container\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./SampleSource.txt\", \"rb\") as data:\n    blob.upload_blob(data)\n```\n\nUse the async client to upload a blob\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./SampleSource.txt\", \"rb\") as data:\n    await blob.upload_blob(data)\n```\n\n### Downloading a blob\nDownload a blob from your container\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./BlockDestination.txt\", \"wb\") as my_blob:\n    blob_data = blob.download_blob()\n    blob_data.readinto(my_blob)\n```\n\nDownload a blob asynchronously\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./BlockDestination.txt\", \"wb\") as my_blob:\n    stream = await blob.download_blob()\n    data = await stream.readall()\n    my_blob.write(data)\n```\n\n### Enumerating blobs\nList the blobs in your container\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\nblob_list = container.list_blobs()\nfor blob in blob_list:\n    print(blob.name + '\\n')\n```\n\nList the blobs asynchronously\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\nblob_list = []\nasync for blob in container.list_blobs():\n    blob_list.append(blob)\nprint(blob_list)\n```\n\n## Optional Configuration\n\nOptional keyword arguments that can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.\n\n### Retry Policy configuration\n\nUse the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure the retry policy:\n\n* __retry_total__ (int): Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.\nPass in `retry_total=0` if you do not want to retry on requests. Defaults to 10.\n* __retry_connect__ (int): How many connection-related errors to retry on. Defaults to 3.\n* __retry_read__ (int): How many times to retry on read errors. Defaults to 3.\n* __retry_status__ (int): How many times to retry on bad status codes. Defaults to 3.\n* __retry_to_secondary__ (bool): Whether the request should be retried to secondary, if able.\nThis should only be enabled of RA-GRS accounts are used and potentially stale data can be handled.\nDefaults to `False`.\n\n### Encryption configuration\n\nUse the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure encryption:\n\n* __require_encryption__ (bool): If set to True, will enforce that objects are encrypted and decrypt them.\n* __encryption_version__ (str): Specifies the version of encryption to use. Current options are `'2.0'` or `'1.0'` and\nthe default value is `'1.0'`. Version 1.0 is deprecated, and it is **highly recommended** to use version 2.0.\n* __key_encryption_key__ (object): The user-provided key-encryption-key. The instance must implement the following methods:\n    - `wrap_key(key)`--wraps the specified key using an algorithm of the user's choice.\n    - `get_key_wrap_algorithm()`--returns the algorithm used to wrap the specified symmetric key.\n    - `get_kid()`--returns a string key id for this key-encryption-key.\n* __key_resolver_function__ (callable): The user-provided key resolver. Uses the kid string to return a key-encryption-key\nimplementing the interface defined above.\n\n### Other client / per-operation configuration\n\nOther optional configuration keyword arguments that can be specified on the client or per-operation.\n\n**Client keyword arguments:**\n\n* __connection_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait to establish a connection to the server.\nDefaults to 20 seconds.\n* __read_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait, between consecutive read operations, for a\nresponse from the server. This is a socket level timeout and is not affected by overall data size. Client-side read \ntimeouts will be automatically retried. Defaults to 60 seconds.\n* __transport__ (Any): User-provided transport to send the HTTP request.\n\n**Per-operation keyword arguments:**\n\n* __raw_response_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the response returned from the service.\n* __raw_request_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the request before being sent to service.\n* __client_request_id__ (str): Optional user specified identification of the request.\n* __user_agent__ (str): Appends the custom value to the user-agent header to be sent with the request.\n* __logging_enable__ (bool): Enables logging at the DEBUG level. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at\nthe client level to enable it for all requests.\n* __logging_body__ (bool): Enables logging the request and response body. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at\nthe client level to enable it for all requests.\n* __headers__ (dict): Pass in custom headers as key, value pairs. E.g. `headers={'CustomValue': value}`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n### General\nStorage Blob clients raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).\n\nThis list can be used for reference to catch thrown exceptions. To get the specific error code of the exception, use the `error_code` attribute, i.e, `exception.error_code`.\n\n### Logging\nThis library uses the standard\n[logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library for logging.\nBasic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO\nlevel.\n\nDetailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted\nheaders, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport logging\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n\n# Create a logger for the 'azure.storage.blob' SDK\nlogger = logging.getLogger('azure.storage.blob')\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Configure a console output\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\n# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG level\nservice_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(\"your_connection_string\", logging_enable=True)\n```\n\nSimilarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,\neven when it isn't enabled for the client:\n```py\nservice_client.get_service_stats(logging_enable=True)\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n### More sample code\n\nGet started with our [Blob samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples).\n\nSeveral Storage Blobs Python SDK samples are available to you in the SDK's GitHub repository.

      "description": "Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Client Library for Python\n# Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python\nAzure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.\n\nBlob storage is ideal for:\n\n* Serving images or documents directly to a browser\n* Storing files for distributed access\n* Streaming video and audio\n* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving\n* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service\n\n[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/azure/storage/blob) | [Package (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-blob/) | [API reference documentation](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-ref) | [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples)\n\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n* Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please read our page on [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).\n* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an\n[Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) to use this package.\n\n### Install the package\nInstall the Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):\n\n```bash\npip install azure-storage-blob\n```\n\n### Create a storage account\nIf you wish to create a new storage account, you can use the\n[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal),\n[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-powershell),\nor [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-cli):\n\n```bash\n# Create a new resource group to hold the storage account -\n# if using an existing resource group, skip this step\naz group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2\n\n# Create the storage account\naz storage account create -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group\n```\n\n### Create the client\nThe Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python allows you to interact with three types of resources: the storage\naccount itself, blob storage containers, and blobs. Interaction with these resources starts with an instance of a\n[client](#clients). To create a client object, you will need the storage account's blob service account URL and a\ncredential that allows you to access the storage account:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n\nservice = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/\", credential=credential)\n```\n\n#### Looking up the account URL\nYou can find the storage account's blob service URL using the\n[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#storage-account-endpoints),\n[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccount),\nor [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-account-show):\n\n```bash\n# Get the blob service account url for the storage account\naz storage account show -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group --query \"primaryEndpoints.blob\"\n```\n\n#### Types of credentials\nThe `credential` parameter may be provided in a number of different forms, depending on the type of\n[authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth) you wish to use:\n1. To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad),\n   provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the\n   [azure-identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#credentials) library.\n   For example, [DefaultAzureCredential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#defaultazurecredential)\n   can be used to authenticate the client.\n\n   This requires some initial setup:\n   * [Install azure-identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#install-the-package)\n   * [Register a new AAD application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) and give permissions to access Azure Storage\n   * [Grant access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal) to Azure Blob data with RBAC in the Azure Portal\n   * Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:\n     AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET\n\n   Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:\n    ```python\n        from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n        from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n        token_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n        blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(\n            account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\",\n            credential=token_credential\n        )\n    ```\n\n2. To use a [shared access signature (SAS) token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview),\n   provide the token as a string. If your account URL includes the SAS token, omit the credential parameter.\n   You can generate a SAS token from the Azure Portal under \"Shared access signature\" or use one of the `generate_sas()`\n   functions to create a sas token for the storage account, container, or blob:\n\n    ```python\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, generate_account_sas, ResourceTypes, AccountSasPermissions\n\n    sas_token = generate_account_sas(\n        account_name=\"<storage-account-name>\",\n        account_key=\"<account-access-key>\",\n        resource_types=ResourceTypes(service=True),\n        permission=AccountSasPermissions(read=True),\n        expiry=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)\n    )\n\n    blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\", credential=sas_token)\n    ```\n\n3. To use a storage account [shared key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/authenticate-with-shared-key/)\n   (aka account key or access key), provide the key as a string. This can be found in the Azure Portal under the \"Access Keys\"\n   section or by running the following Azure CLI command:\n\n    ```az storage account keys list -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount```\n\n    Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:\n    ```python\n    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n    service = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\", credential=\"<account_access_key>\")\n    ```\n    \n    If you are using **customized url** (which means the url is not in this format `<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net`),\n    please instantiate the client using the credential below:\n    ```python\n    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n    service = BlobServiceClient(account_url=\"https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net\", \n       credential={\"account_name\": \"<your_account_name>\", \"account_key\":\"<account_access_key>\"})\n    ```\n\n4. To use [anonymous public read access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-manage-access-to-resources),\n   simply omit the credential parameter.\n\n#### Creating the client from a connection string\nDepending on your use case and authorization method, you may prefer to initialize a client instance with a storage\nconnection string instead of providing the account URL and credential separately. To do this, pass the storage\nconnection string to the client's `from_connection_string` class method:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n\nconnection_string = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=xxxx;AccountKey=xxxx;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net\"\nservice = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=connection_string)\n```\n\nThe connection string to your storage account can be found in the Azure Portal under the \"Access Keys\" section or by running the following CLI command:\n\n```bash\naz storage account show-connection-string -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount\n```\n\n## Key concepts\nThe following components make up the Azure Blob Service:\n* The storage account itself\n* A container within the storage account\n* A blob within a container\n\nThe Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python allows you to interact with each of these components through the\nuse of a dedicated client object.\n\n### Clients\nFour different clients are provided to interact with the various components of the Blob Service:\n1. [BlobServiceClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-blobserviceclient) -\n    this client represents interaction with the Azure storage account itself, and allows you to acquire preconfigured\n    client instances to access the containers and blobs within. It provides operations to retrieve and configure the\n    account properties as well as list, create, and delete containers within the account. To perform operations on a\n    specific container or blob, retrieve a client using the `get_container_client` or `get_blob_client` methods.\n2. [ContainerClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-containerclient) -\n    this client represents interaction with a specific container (which need not exist yet), and allows you to acquire\n    preconfigured client instances to access the blobs within. It provides operations to create, delete, or configure a\n    container and includes operations to list, upload, and delete the blobs within it. To perform operations on a\n    specific blob within the container, retrieve a client using the `get_blob_client` method.\n3. [BlobClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-blobclient) -\n    this client represents interaction with a specific blob (which need not exist yet). It provides operations to\n    upload, download, delete, and create snapshots of a blob, as well as specific operations per blob type.\n4. [BlobLeaseClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-blob-blobleaseclient) -\n    this client represents lease interactions with a `ContainerClient` or `BlobClient`. It provides operations to\n    acquire, renew, release, change, and break a lease on a specified resource.\n\n### Async Clients \nThis library includes a complete async API supported on Python 3.5+. To use it, you must\nfirst install an async transport, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/).\nSee\n[azure-core documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#transport)\nfor more information.\n\nAsync clients and credentials should be closed when they're no longer needed. These\nobjects are async context managers and define async `close` methods.\n\n### Blob Types\nOnce you've initialized a Client, you can choose from the different types of blobs:\n* [Block blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-block-blobs)\n  store text and binary data, up to approximately 4.75 TiB. Block blobs are made up of blocks of data that can be\n  managed individually\n* [Append blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-append-blobs)\n  are made up of blocks like block blobs, but are optimized for append operations. Append blobs are ideal for scenarios\n  such as logging data from virtual machines\n* [Page blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-page-blobs)\n  store random access files up to 8 TiB in size. Page blobs store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for\n  Azure virtual machines\n\n## Examples\nThe following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Storage Blob tasks, including:\n\n* [Create a container](#create-a-container \"Create a container\")\n* [Uploading a blob](#uploading-a-blob \"Uploading a blob\")\n* [Downloading a blob](#downloading-a-blob \"Downloading a blob\")\n* [Enumerating blobs](#enumerating-blobs \"Enumerating blobs\")\n\nNote that a container must be created before to upload or download a blob.\n\n### Create a container\n\nCreate a container from where you can upload or download blobs.\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer_client = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\ncontainer_client.create_container()\n```\n\nUse the async client to upload a blob\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer_client = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\nawait container_client.create_container()\n```\n\n### Uploading a blob\nUpload a blob to your container\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./SampleSource.txt\", \"rb\") as data:\n    blob.upload_blob(data)\n```\n\nUse the async client to upload a blob\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"<connection_string>\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./SampleSource.txt\", \"rb\") as data:\n    await blob.upload_blob(data)\n```\n\n### Downloading a blob\nDownload a blob from your container\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./BlockDestination.txt\", \"wb\") as my_blob:\n    blob_data = blob.download_blob()\n    blob_data.readinto(my_blob)\n```\n\nDownload a blob asynchronously\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import BlobClient\n\nblob = BlobClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\", blob_name=\"my_blob\")\n\nwith open(\"./BlockDestination.txt\", \"wb\") as my_blob:\n    stream = await blob.download_blob()\n    data = await stream.readall()\n    my_blob.write(data)\n```\n\n### Enumerating blobs\nList the blobs in your container\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\nblob_list = container.list_blobs()\nfor blob in blob_list:\n    print(blob.name + '\\n')\n```\n\nList the blobs asynchronously\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob.aio import ContainerClient\n\ncontainer = ContainerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=\"my_connection_string\", container_name=\"my_container\")\n\nblob_list = []\nasync for blob in container.list_blobs():\n    blob_list.append(blob)\nprint(blob_list)\n```\n\n## Optional Configuration\n\nOptional keyword arguments that can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.\n\n### Retry Policy configuration\n\nUse the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure the retry policy:\n\n* __retry_total__ (int): Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.\nPass in `retry_total=0` if you do not want to retry on requests. Defaults to 10.\n* __retry_connect__ (int): How many connection-related errors to retry on. Defaults to 3.\n* __retry_read__ (int): How many times to retry on read errors. Defaults to 3.\n* __retry_status__ (int): How many times to retry on bad status codes. Defaults to 3.\n* __retry_to_secondary__ (bool): Whether the request should be retried to secondary, if able.\nThis should only be enabled of RA-GRS accounts are used and potentially stale data can be handled.\nDefaults to `False`.\n\n### Encryption configuration\n\nUse the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure encryption:\n\n* __require_encryption__ (bool): If set to True, will enforce that objects are encrypted and decrypt them.\n* __encryption_version__ (str): Specifies the version of encryption to use. Current options are `'2.0'` or `'1.0'` and\nthe default value is `'1.0'`. Version 1.0 is deprecated, and it is **highly recommended** to use version 2.0.\n* __key_encryption_key__ (object): The user-provided key-encryption-key. The instance must implement the following methods:\n    - `wrap_key(key)`--wraps the specified key using an algorithm of the user's choice.\n    - `get_key_wrap_algorithm()`--returns the algorithm used to wrap the specified symmetric key.\n    - `get_kid()`--returns a string key id for this key-encryption-key.\n* __key_resolver_function__ (callable): The user-provided key resolver. Uses the kid string to return a key-encryption-key\nimplementing the interface defined above.\n\n### Other client / per-operation configuration\n\nOther optional configuration keyword arguments that can be specified on the client or per-operation.\n\n**Client keyword arguments:**\n\n* __connection_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait to establish a connection to the server.\nDefaults to 20 seconds.\n* __read_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait, between consecutive read operations, for a\nresponse from the server. This is a socket level timeout and is not affected by overall data size. Client-side read \ntimeouts will be automatically retried. Defaults to 60 seconds.\n* __transport__ (Any): User-provided transport to send the HTTP request.\n\n**Per-operation keyword arguments:**\n\n* __raw_response_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the response returned from the service.\n* __raw_request_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the request before being sent to service.\n* __client_request_id__ (str): Optional user specified identification of the request.\n* __user_agent__ (str): Appends the custom value to the user-agent header to be sent with the request.\n* __logging_enable__ (bool): Enables logging at the DEBUG level. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at\nthe client level to enable it for all requests.\n* __logging_body__ (bool): Enables logging the request and response body. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at\nthe client level to enable it for all requests.\n* __headers__ (dict): Pass in custom headers as key, value pairs. E.g. `headers={'CustomValue': value}`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n### General\nStorage Blob clients raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).\n\nThis list can be used for reference to catch thrown exceptions. To get the specific error code of the exception, use the `error_code` attribute, i.e, `exception.error_code`.\n\n### Logging\nThis library uses the standard\n[logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library for logging.\nBasic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO\nlevel.\n\nDetailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted\nheaders, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport logging\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient\n\n# Create a logger for the 'azure.storage.blob' SDK\nlogger = logging.getLogger('azure.storage.blob')\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Configure a console output\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\n# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG level\nservice_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(\"your_connection_string\", logging_enable=True)\n```\n\nSimilarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,\neven when it isn't enabled for the client:\n```py\nservice_client.get_service_stats(logging_enable=True)\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n### More sample code\n\nGet started with our [Blob samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples).\n\nSeveral Storage Blobs Python SDK samples are available to you in the SDK's GitHub repository.

It has been extracted from the `Requests`_ project.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``certifi`` is available on PyPI. Simply install it with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install certifi\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the\nbuilt-in function::\n\n    >>> import certifi\n\n    >>> certifi.where()\n    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'\n\nOr from the command line::\n\n    $ python -m certifi\n    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem\n\nEnjoy!\n\n1024-bit Root Certificates\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBrowsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys are\nunacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. For this\nreason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) certificate from its\nbundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e. 2048-bit or greater key)\ncertificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla removed these certificates from\nits bundle, ``certifi`` removed them as well.\n\nIn previous versions, ``certifi`` provided the ``certifi.old_where()`` function\nto intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your bundle. This was not\nrecommended in production and therefore was removed at the end of 2018.\n\n.. _`Requests`: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/\n\nAddition/Removal of Certificates\n--------------------------------\n\nCertifi does not support any addition/removal or other modification of the\nCA trust store content. This project is intended to provide a reliable and\nhighly portable root of trust to python deployments. Look to upstream projects\nfor methods to use alternate trust.",

      "description": "Python package for providing Mozilla's CA Bundle.\nCertifi: Python SSL Certificates\n================================\n\nCertifi provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for\nvalidating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity\nof TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the `Requests`_ project.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``certifi`` is available on PyPI. Simply install it with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install certifi\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the\nbuilt-in function::\n\n    >>> import certifi\n\n    >>> certifi.where()\n    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'\n\nOr from the command line::\n\n    $ python -m certifi\n    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem\n\nEnjoy!\n\n1024-bit Root Certificates\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBrowsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys are\nunacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. For this\nreason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) certificate from its\nbundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e. 2048-bit or greater key)\ncertificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla removed these certificates from\nits bundle, ``certifi`` removed them as well.\n\nIn previous versions, ``certifi`` provided the ``certifi.old_where()`` function\nto intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your bundle. This was not\nrecommended in production and therefore was removed at the end of 2018.\n\n.. _`Requests`: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/\n\nAddition/Removal of Certificates\n--------------------------------\n\nCertifi does not support any addition/removal or other modification of the\nCA trust store content. This project is intended to provide a reliable and\nhighly portable root of trust to python deployments. Look to upstream projects\nfor methods to use alternate trust.",

We do listen.*\n  \n## \u26a1 Performance\n\nThis package offer better performance than its counterpart Chardet. Here are some numbers.\n\n| Package                                       | Accuracy | Mean per file (ms) | File per sec (est) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |   86 %   |       200 ms       |     5 file/sec     |\n| charset-normalizer                            | **98 %** |     **10 ms**      |    100 file/sec    |\n\n| Package                                       | 99th percentile | 95th percentile | 50th percentile |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |     1200 ms     |     287 ms      |      23 ms      |\n| charset-normalizer                            |     100 ms      |      50 ms      |      5 ms       |\n\nChardet's performance on larger file (1MB+) are very poor. Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (eg. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## \u2728 Installation\n\nUsing PyPi for latest stable\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## \ud83d\ude07 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can. \n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? \ud83d\ude0e\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## \ud83c\udf70 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess.\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## \u26a1 Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## \ud83d\udc64 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project \u00a9 2012 [Denny Vrande\u010di\u0107](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## \ud83d\udcbc For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

(+Using static typing)+\n- utf_7 detection has been reinstated.\n\n### Removed\n- This package no longer require anything when used with Python 3.5 (Dropped cached_property)\n- Removed support for these languages: Catalan, Esperanto, Kazakh, Baque, Volap\u00fck, Azeri, Galician, Nynorsk, Macedonian, and Serbocroatian.\n- The exception hook on UnicodeDecodeError has been removed.\n\n### Deprecated\n- Methods coherence_non_latin, w_counter, chaos_secondary_pass of the class CharsetMatch are now deprecated and scheduled for removal in v3.0\n\n### Fixed\n- The CLI output used the relative path of the file(s). Should be absolute.\n\n## [1.4.1](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.4.0...1.4.1) (2021-05-28)\n### Fixed\n- Logger configuration/usage no longer conflict with others (PR #44)\n\n## [1.4.0](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.9...1.4.0) (2021-05-21)\n### Removed\n- Using standard logging instead of using the package loguru.\n- Dropping nose test framework in favor of the maintained pytest.\n- Choose to not use dragonmapper package to help with gibberish Chinese/CJK text.\n- Require cached_property only for Python 3.5 due to constraint. Dropping for every other interpreter version.\n- Stop support for UTF-7 that does not contain a SIG.\n- Dropping PrettyTable, replaced with pure JSON output in CLI.\n\n### Fixed\n- BOM marker in a CharsetNormalizerMatch instance could be False in rare cases even if obviously present. Due to the sub-match factoring process.\n- Not searching properly for the BOM when trying utf32/16 parent codec.\n\n### Changed\n- Improving the package final size by compressing frequencies.json.\n- Huge improvement over the larges payload.\n\n### Added\n- CLI now produces JSON consumable output.\n- Return ASCII if given sequences fit. Given reasonable confidence.\n\n## [1.3.9](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.8...1.3.9) (2021-05-13)\n\n### Fixed\n- In some very rare cases, you may end up getting encode/decode errors due to a bad bytes payload (PR #40)\n\n## [1.3.8](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.7...1.3.8) (2021-05-12)\n\n### Fixed\n- Empty given payload for detection may cause an exception if trying to access the `alphabets` property. (PR #39)\n\n## [1.3.7](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.6...1.3.7) (2021-05-12)\n\n### Fixed\n- The legacy detect function should return UTF-8-SIG if sig is present in the payload. (PR #38)\n\n## [1.3.6](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.5...1.3.6) (2021-02-09)\n\n### Changed\n- Amend the previous release to allow prettytable 2.0 (PR #35)\n\n## [1.3.5](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.4...1.3.5) (2021-02-08)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix error while using the package with a python pre-release interpreter (PR #33)\n\n### Changed\n- Dependencies refactoring, constraints revised.\n\n### Added\n- Add python 3.9 and 3.10 to the supported interpreters\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 TAHRI Ahmed R.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (eg. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## \u2728 Installation\n\nUsing PyPi for latest stable\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## \ud83d\ude07 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can. \n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? \ud83d\ude0e\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## \ud83c\udf70 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess.\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## \u26a1 Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## \ud83d\udc64 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project \u00a9 2012 [Denny Vrande\u010di\u0107](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## \ud83d\udcbc For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

This is the latest version of\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as \u201cIDNA 2008\u201d.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the \u201cencodings.idna\u201d\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    \u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    \u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print('\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d.\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435'.encode('idna'))\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna'))\n    \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d.\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('\u6d4b\u8bd5')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\na \u201cmapping\u201d, is considered by the specification to be a local\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping, that was developed by the\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, \u201cK\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen\u201d is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    k\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (\u00df) was\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.encode('K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementors should use transitional processing with caution, only in\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\nresults.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\nmodule name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables using for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementors who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to use in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older intepreter support.\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\n\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\n  While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable\n  issues being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your\n  requirements file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that wish need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`.

If something is not\nmentioned there, then it is treated as non existent, and not as an allowed\noption.\n\nFor instance, ISO8601:2004 never mentions 2 digit years. So, it is not\nintended by this module to support 2 digit years. (while it may still\nbe valid as ISO date, because it is not explicitly forbidden.)\nAnother example is, when no time zone information is given for a time,\nthen it should be interpreted as local time, and not UTC.\n\nAs this module maps ISO 8601 dates/times to standard Python data types, like\n*date*, *time*, *datetime* and *timedelta*, it is not possible to convert\nall possible ISO 8601 dates/times. For instance, dates before 0001-01-01 are\nnot allowed by the Python *date* and *datetime* classes. Additionally\nfractional seconds are limited to microseconds. That means if the parser finds\nfor instance nanoseconds it will round it to microseconds.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nCurrently there are four parsing methods available.\n   * parse_time:\n        parses an ISO 8601 time string into a *time* object\n   * parse_date:\n        parses an ISO 8601 date string into a *date* object\n   * parse_datetime:\n        parses an ISO 8601 date-time string into a *datetime* object\n   * parse_duration:\n        parses an ISO 8601 duration string into a *timedelta* or *Duration*\n        object.\n   * parse_tzinfo:\n        parses the time zone info part of an ISO 8601 string into a\n        *tzinfo* object.\n\nAs ISO 8601 allows to define durations in years and months, and *timedelta*\ndoes not handle years and months, this module provides a *Duration* class,\nwhich can be used almost like a *timedelta* object (with some limitations).\nHowever, a *Duration* object can be converted into a *timedelta* object.\n\nThere are also ISO formatting methods for all supported data types. Each\n*xxx_isoformat* method accepts a format parameter. The default format is\nalways the ISO 8601 expanded format. This is the same format used by\n*datetime.isoformat*:\n\n    * time_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO time strings with default format\n        *hh:mm:ssZ*.\n    * date_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO date strings with default format\n        *yyyy-mm-dd*.\n    * datetime_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO date-time strings with default format\n        *yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ*.\n    * duration_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO duration strings with default format\n        *PnnYnnMnnDTnnHnnMnnS*.\n    * tz_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO time zone strings with default format\n        *hh:mm*.\n    * strftime:\n        A re-implementation mostly compatible with Python's *strftime*, but\n        supports only those format strings, which can also be used for dates\n        prior 1900. This method also understands how to format *datetime* and\n        *Duration* instances.\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\nThis module can easily be installed with Python standard installation methods.\n\nEither use *python setup.py install* or in case you have *setuptools* or\n*distribute* available, you can also use *easy_install*.\n\nLimitations:\n------------\n\n   * The parser accepts several date/time representation which should be invalid\n     according to ISO 8601 standard.\n\n     1. for date and time together, this parser accepts a mixture of basic and extended format.\n        e.g. the date could be in basic format, while the time is accepted in extended format.\n        It also allows short dates and times in date-time strings.\n     2. For incomplete dates, the first day is chosen. e.g. 19th century results in a date of\n        1901-01-01.\n     3. negative *Duration* and *timedelta* value are not fully supported yet.\n\nFurther information:\n--------------------\n\nThe doc strings and unit tests should provide rather detailed information about\nthe methods and their limitations.\n\nThe source release provides a *setup.py* script,\nwhich can be used to run the unit tests included.\n\nSource code is available at `<http://github.com/gweis/isodate>`_.\n\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n0.6.1 (2021-12-13)\n------------------\n\n- support python 3.10 ()\n- last version to support py 2.7\n\n\n0.6.0 (2017-10-13)\n------------------\n\n- support incomplete month date (Fabien Loffredo)\n- rely on duck typing when doing duration maths\n- support ':' as separator in fractional time zones (usrenmae)\n\n\n0.5.4 (2015-08-06)\n------------------\n\n- Fix parsing of Periods (Fabien Bochu)\n- Make Duration objects hashable (Geoffrey Fairchild)\n- Add multiplication to duration (Reinoud Elhorst)\n\n\n0.5.1 (2014-11-07)\n------------------\n\n- fixed pickling of Duration objects\n- raise ISO8601Error when there is no 'T' separator in datetime strings (Adrian Coveney)\n\n\n0.5.0 (2014-02-23)\n------------------\n\n- ISO8601Error are subclasses of ValueError now (Michael Hrivnak)\n- improve compatibility across various python variants and versions\n- raise exceptions when using fractional years and months in date\n  maths with durations\n- renamed method todatetime on Duraction objects to totimedelta\n\n\n0.4.9 (2012-10-30)\n------------------\n\n- support pickling FixedOffset instances\n- make sure parsed fractional seconds are in microseconds\n- add leading zeros when formattig microseconds (Jarom Loveridge)\n\n\n0.4.8 (2012-05-04)\n------------------\n\n- fixed incompatibility of unittests with python 2.5 and 2.6 (runs fine on 2.7\n  and 3.2)\n\n\n0.4.7 (2012-01-26)\n------------------\n\n- fixed tzinfo formatting (never pass None into tzinfo.utcoffset())\n\n\n0.4.6 (2012-01-06)\n------------------\n\n- added Python 3 compatibility via 2to3\n\n0.4.5 (2012-01-06)\n------------------\n\n- made setuptools dependency optional\n\n0.4.4 (2011-04-16)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed formatting of microseconds for datetime objects\n\n0.4.3 (2010-10-29)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed problem with %P formating and fractions (supplied by David Brooks)\n\n0.4.2 (2010-10-28)\n------------------\n\n- Implemented unary - for Duration (supplied by David Brooks)\n- Output fractional seconds with '%P' format.

Only implementation is `requests` for now. This driver API is *not* considered stable\n  and you should pin your msrest version if you want to provide a personal implementation.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Incorrect milliseconds serialization for some datetime object #94\n\n**Deprecation**\n\nThat will trigger a DeprecationWarning if an old Autorest generated code is used.\n\n- _client.add_header is deprecated, and config.headers should be used instead\n- _client.send_formdata is deprecated, and _client.put/get/delete/post + _client.send should be used instead\n\n2018-04-30 Version 0.4.29\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Improve `SDKClient.__exit__` to take exc_details as optional parameters and not required #93\n- refresh_session should also use the permanent HTTP session if available #91\n\n2018-04-18 Version 0.4.28\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- msrest is now able to keep the \"requests.Session\" alive for performance. To activate this behavior:\n\n  - Use the final Client as a context manager (requires generation with Autorest.Python 3.0.50 at least)\n  - Use `client.config.keep_alive = True` and `client.close()` (requires generation with Autorest.Python 3.0.50 at least)\n  - Use `client.config.keep_alive = True` and client._client.close() (not recommended, but available in old releases of SDK)\n\n- All Authentication classes now define `signed_session` and `refresh_session` with an optional `session` parameter.\n  To take benefits of the session improvement, a subclass of Authentication *MUST* add this optional parameter\n  and use it if it's not `None`:\n\n     def signed_session(self, session=None):\n         session = session or requests.Session()\n\n         # As usual from here.\n\n2018-03-07 Version 0.4.27\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Disable HTTP log by default (security), add `enable_http_log` to restore it #86\n\n**BugFixes**\n\n- Fix incorrect date parsing if ms precision is over 6 digits #82\n\n2018-01-30 Version 0.4.26\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add TopicCredentials for EventGrid client\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix minimal dependency of isodate\n- Fix serialisation from dict if datetime provided\n\n2018-01-08 Version 0.4.25\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add LROPoller class. This is a customizable LRO engine.\n  This is the poller engine of Autorest.Python 3.0, and is not used by code generated by previous Autorest version.\n\n2018-01-03 Version 0.4.24\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Date parsing is now compliant with Autorest / Swagger 2.0 specification (less lenient)\n\n**Internal optimisation**\n\n- Call that does not return a streamable object are now executed in requests stream mode False (was True whatever the type of the call).\n  This should reduce the number of leaked opened session and allow urllib3 to manage connection pooling more efficiently.\n  Only clients generated with Autorest.Python >= 2.1.31 (not impacted otherwise, fully backward compatible)\n\n2017-12-21 Version 0.4.23\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Accept to deserialize enum of different type if content string match #75\n- Stop failing on deserialization if enum string is unkwon. Return the string instead.\n\n**Features**\n\n- Model now accept kwargs in constructor for future kwargs models\n\n2017-12-15 Version 0.4.22\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Do not validate additional_properties #73\n- Improve validation error if expected type is dict, but actual type is not #73\n\n2017-12-14 Version 0.4.21\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix additional_properties if Swagger was flatten #72\n\n2017-12-13 Version 0.4.20\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add support for additional_properties\n\n  - By default, all additional_properties are kept.\n  - Additional properties are sent to the server only if it was specified in the Swagger,\n    or if \"enable_additional_properties_sending\" is called on the model we want it.\n    This is a class method that enables it for all instance of this model.\n\n2017-11-20 Version 0.4.19\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- The interpretation of Swagger 2.0 \"discriminator\" is now lenient. This means for these two scenarios:\n\n  - Discriminator value is missing from the received payload\n  - Discriminator value is not defined in the Swagger\n\n  Instead of failing with an exception, this now returns the base type for this \"discriminator\".\n\n  Note that this is not a contradiction of the Swagger 2.0 spec, that specifies\n  \"validation SHOULD fail [...] there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item,\n  but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.\"\n\n  This cannot be configured for now and is the new default behvaior, but can be in the future if needed.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Optional formdata parameters were raising an exception (#65)\n- \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" form was sent using \"multipart/form-data\".\n  This causes problems if the server does not support \"multipart/form-data\" (#66)\n\n2017-10-26 Version 0.4.18\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add ApiKeyCredentials class. This can be used to support OpenAPI ApiKey feature.\n- Add CognitiveServicesAuthentication class. Pre-declared ApiKeyCredentials class for Cognitive Services.\n\n2017-10-12 Version 0.4.17\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\nThis make Authentication classes more consistent:\n\n- OAuthTokenAuthentication is now a subclass of BasicTokenAuthentication (was Authentication)\n- BasicTokenAuthentication has now a \"set_token\" methods that does nothing.\n\nThis allows test like \"isintance(o, BasicTokenAuthentication)\" to be guaranted that the following attributes exists:\n\n- token\n- set_token()\n- signed_session()\n\nThis means for users of \"msrestazure\", that they are guaranted that all AD classes somehow inherits from \"BasicTokenAuthentication\"\n\n2017-10-05 Version 0.4.16\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression: accept \"set<str>\" as a valid \"[str]\" (#60)\n\n2017-09-28 Version 0.4.15\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Always log response body (#16)\n- Improved exception message if error JSON is Odata v4 (#55)\n- Refuse \"str\" as a valid \"[str]\" type (#41)\n- Better exception handling if input from server is not JSON valid\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add Configuration.session_configuration_callback to customize the requests.Session if necessary (#52)\n- Add a flag to Serializer to disable client-side-validation (#51)\n- Remove \"import requests\" from \"exceptions.py\" for apps that require fast loading time (#23)\n\nThank you to jayden-at-arista for the contribution\n\n2017-08-23 Version 0.4.14\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression introduced in msrest 0.4.12 - dict syntax with enum modeled as string and enum used\n\n2017-08-22 Version 0.4.13\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression introduced in msrest 0.4.12 - dict syntax using isodate.Duration (#42)\n\n2017-08-21 Version 0.4.12\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Input is now more lenient\n- Model have a \"validate\" method to check content constraints\n- Model have now 4 new methods:\n\n  - \"serialize\" that gives the RestAPI that will be sent\n  - \"as_dict\" that returns a dict version of the Model. Callbacks are available.\n  - \"deserialize\" the parses the RestAPI JSON into a Model\n  - \"from_dict\" that parses several dict syntax into a Model. Callbacks are available.\n\nMore details and examples in the Wiki article on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Azure/msrest-for-python/wiki/msrest-0.4.12---Serialization-change\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Better Enum checking (#38)\n\n2017-06-21 Version 0.4.11\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix incorrect dependency to \"requests\" 2.14.x, instead of 2.x meant in 0.4.8\n\n2017-06-15 Version 0.4.10\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add requests hooks to configuration\n\n2017-06-08 Version 0.4.9\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Accept \"null\" value for paging array as an empty list and do not raise (#30)\n\n2017-05-22 Version 0.4.8\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix random \"pool is closed\" error (#29)\n- Fix requests dependency to version 2.x, since version 3.x is annunced to be breaking.\n\n2017-04-04 Version 0.4.7\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**BugFixes**\n\n- Refactor paging #22:\n\n   - \"next\" is renamed \"advance_page\" and \"next\" returns only 1 element (Python 2 expected behavior)\n   - paging objects are now real generator and support the \"next()\" built-in function without need for \"iter()\"\n\n- Raise accurate DeserialisationError on incorrect RestAPI discriminator usage #27\n- Fix discriminator usage of the base class name #27\n- Remove default mutable arguments in Clients #20\n- Fix object comparison in some scenarios #24\n\n2017-03-06 Version 0.4.6\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Allow Model sub-classes to be serialized if type is \"object\"\n\n2017-02-13 Version 0.4.5\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix polymorphic deserialization #11\n- Fix regexp validation if '\\\\w' is used in Python 2.7 #13\n- Fix dict deserialization if keys are unicode in Python 2.7\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Add polymorphic serialisation from dict objects\n- Remove chardet and use HTTP charset declaration (fallback to utf8)\n\n2016-09-14 Version 0.4.4\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Remove paging URL validation, part of fix https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/1420\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nIn order to get paging fixes for impacted clients, you need this package and Autorest > 0.17.0 Nightly 20160913\n\n2016-09-01 Version 0.4.3\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Better exception message (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/1300)\n\n2016-08-15 Version 0.4.2\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix serialization if \"object\" type contains None (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/1353)\n\n2016-08-08 Version 0.4.1\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix compatibility issues with requests 2.11.0 (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/1337)\n- Allow url of ClientRequest to have parameters (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/1217)\n\n2016-05-25 Version 0.4.0\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis version has no bug fixes, but implements new features of Autorest:\n- Base64 url type\n- unixtime type\n- x-ms-enum modelAsString flag\n\n**Behaviour changes**\n\n- Add Platform information in UserAgent\n- Needs Autorest > 0.17.0 Nightly 20160525\n\n2016-04-26 Version 0.3.0\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Read only values are no longer in __init__ or sent to the server (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/959)\n- Useless kwarg removed\n\n**Behaviour changes**\n\n- Needs Autorest > 0.16.0 Nightly 20160426\n\n\n2016-03-25 Version 0.2.0\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Manage integer enum values (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/879)\n- Add missing application/json Accept HTTP header (https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/553)\n\n**Behaviour changes**\n\n- Needs Autorest > 0.16.0 Nightly 20160324\n\n\n2016-03-21 Version 0.1.3\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Deserialisation of generic resource if null in JSON (https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/544)\n\n\n2016-03-14 Version 0.1.2\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- urllib3 side effect (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/824)\n\n\n2016-03-04 Version 0.1.1\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Source package corrupted in Pypi (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/799)\n\n2016-03-04 Version 0.1.0\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Behavioural Changes**\n\n- Removed custom logging set up and configuration.

Only implementation is `requests` for now. This driver API is *not* considered stable\n  and you should pin your msrest version if you want to provide a personal implementation.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Incorrect milliseconds serialization for some datetime object #94\n\n**Deprecation**\n\nThat will trigger a DeprecationWarning if an old Autorest generated code is used.\n\n- _client.add_header is deprecated, and config.headers should be used instead\n- _client.send_formdata is deprecated, and _client.put/get/delete/post + _client.send should be used instead\n\n2018-04-30 Version 0.4.29\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Improve `SDKClient.__exit__` to take exc_details as optional parameters and not required #93\n- refresh_session should also use the permanent HTTP session if available #91\n\n2018-04-18 Version 0.4.28\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- msrest is now able to keep the \"requests.Session\" alive for performance. To activate this behavior:\n\n  - Use the final Client as a context manager (requires generation with Autorest.Python 3.0.50 at least)\n  - Use `client.config.keep_alive = True` and `client.close()` (requires generation with Autorest.Python 3.0.50 at least)\n  - Use `client.config.keep_alive = True` and client._client.close() (not recommended, but available in old releases of SDK)\n\n- All Authentication classes now define `signed_session` and `refresh_session` with an optional `session` parameter.\n  To take benefits of the session improvement, a subclass of Authentication *MUST* add this optional parameter\n  and use it if it's not `None`:\n\n     def signed_session(self, session=None):\n         session = session or requests.Session()\n\n         # As usual from here.\n\n2018-03-07 Version 0.4.27\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Disable HTTP log by default (security), add `enable_http_log` to restore it #86\n\n**BugFixes**\n\n- Fix incorrect date parsing if ms precision is over 6 digits #82\n\n2018-01-30 Version 0.4.26\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add TopicCredentials for EventGrid client\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix minimal dependency of isodate\n- Fix serialisation from dict if datetime provided\n\n2018-01-08 Version 0.4.25\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add LROPoller class. This is a customizable LRO engine.\n  This is the poller engine of Autorest.Python 3.0, and is not used by code generated by previous Autorest version.\n\n2018-01-03 Version 0.4.24\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Date parsing is now compliant with Autorest / Swagger 2.0 specification (less lenient)\n\n**Internal optimisation**\n\n- Call that does not return a streamable object are now executed in requests stream mode False (was True whatever the type of the call).\n  This should reduce the number of leaked opened session and allow urllib3 to manage connection pooling more efficiently.\n  Only clients generated with Autorest.Python >= 2.1.31 (not impacted otherwise, fully backward compatible)\n\n2017-12-21 Version 0.4.23\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Accept to deserialize enum of different type if content string match #75\n- Stop failing on deserialization if enum string is unkwon. Return the string instead.\n\n**Features**\n\n- Model now accept kwargs in constructor for future kwargs models\n\n2017-12-15 Version 0.4.22\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Do not validate additional_properties #73\n- Improve validation error if expected type is dict, but actual type is not #73\n\n2017-12-14 Version 0.4.21\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix additional_properties if Swagger was flatten #72\n\n2017-12-13 Version 0.4.20\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add support for additional_properties\n\n  - By default, all additional_properties are kept.\n  - Additional properties are sent to the server only if it was specified in the Swagger,\n    or if \"enable_additional_properties_sending\" is called on the model we want it.\n    This is a class method that enables it for all instance of this model.\n\n2017-11-20 Version 0.4.19\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- The interpretation of Swagger 2.0 \"discriminator\" is now lenient. This means for these two scenarios:\n\n  - Discriminator value is missing from the received payload\n  - Discriminator value is not defined in the Swagger\n\n  Instead of failing with an exception, this now returns the base type for this \"discriminator\".\n\n  Note that this is not a contradiction of the Swagger 2.0 spec, that specifies\n  \"validation SHOULD fail [...] there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item,\n  but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.\"\n\n  This cannot be configured for now and is the new default behvaior, but can be in the future if needed.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Optional formdata parameters were raising an exception (#65)\n- \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" form was sent using \"multipart/form-data\".\n  This causes problems if the server does not support \"multipart/form-data\" (#66)\n\n2017-10-26 Version 0.4.18\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add ApiKeyCredentials class. This can be used to support OpenAPI ApiKey feature.\n- Add CognitiveServicesAuthentication class. Pre-declared ApiKeyCredentials class for Cognitive Services.\n\n2017-10-12 Version 0.4.17\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\nThis make Authentication classes more consistent:\n\n- OAuthTokenAuthentication is now a subclass of BasicTokenAuthentication (was Authentication)\n- BasicTokenAuthentication has now a \"set_token\" methods that does nothing.\n\nThis allows test like \"isintance(o, BasicTokenAuthentication)\" to be guaranted that the following attributes exists:\n\n- token\n- set_token()\n- signed_session()\n\nThis means for users of \"msrestazure\", that they are guaranted that all AD classes somehow inherits from \"BasicTokenAuthentication\"\n\n2017-10-05 Version 0.4.16\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression: accept \"set<str>\" as a valid \"[str]\" (#60)\n\n2017-09-28 Version 0.4.15\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Always log response body (#16)\n- Improved exception message if error JSON is Odata v4 (#55)\n- Refuse \"str\" as a valid \"[str]\" type (#41)\n- Better exception handling if input from server is not JSON valid\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add Configuration.session_configuration_callback to customize the requests.Session if necessary (#52)\n- Add a flag to Serializer to disable client-side-validation (#51)\n- Remove \"import requests\" from \"exceptions.py\" for apps that require fast loading time (#23)\n\nThank you to jayden-at-arista for the contribution\n\n2017-08-23 Version 0.4.14\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression introduced in msrest 0.4.12 - dict syntax with enum modeled as string and enum used\n\n2017-08-22 Version 0.4.13\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression introduced in msrest 0.4.12 - dict syntax using isodate.Duration (#42)\n\n2017-08-21 Version 0.4.12\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Input is now more lenient\n- Model have a \"validate\" method to check content constraints\n- Model have now 4 new methods:\n\n  - \"serialize\" that gives the RestAPI that will be sent\n  - \"as_dict\" that returns a dict version of the Model. Callbacks are available.\n  - \"deserialize\" the parses the RestAPI JSON into a Model\n  - \"from_dict\" that parses several dict syntax into a Model. Callbacks are available.\n\nMore details and examples in the Wiki article on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Azure/msrest-for-python/wiki/msrest-0.4.12---Serialization-change\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Better Enum checking (#38)\n\n2017-06-21 Version 0.4.11\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix incorrect dependency to \"requests\" 2.14.x, instead of 2.x meant in 0.4.8\n\n2017-06-15 Version 0.4.10\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add requests hooks to configuration\n\n2017-06-08 Version 0.4.9\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Accept \"null\" value for paging array as an empty list and do not raise (#30)\n\n2017-05-22 Version 0.4.8\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix random \"pool is closed\" error (#29)\n- Fix requests dependency to version 2.x, since version 3.x is annunced to be breaking.\n\n2017-04-04 Version 0.4.7\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**BugFixes**\n\n- Refactor paging #22:\n\n   - \"next\" is renamed \"advance_page\" and \"next\" returns only 1 element (Python 2 expected behavior)\n   - paging objects are now real generator and support the \"next()\" built-in function without need for \"iter()\"\n\n- Raise accurate DeserialisationError on incorrect RestAPI discriminator usage #27\n- Fix discriminator usage of the base class name #27\n- Remove default mutable arguments in Clients #20\n- Fix object comparison in some scenarios #24\n\n2017-03-06 Version 0.4.6\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Allow Model sub-classes to be serialized if type is \"object\"\n\n2017-02-13 Version 0.4.5\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix polymorphic deserialization #11\n- Fix regexp validation if '\\\\w' is used in Python 2.7 #13\n- Fix dict deserialization if keys are unicode in Python 2.7\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Add polymorphic serialisation from dict objects\n- Remove chardet and use HTTP charset declaration (fallback to utf8)\n\n2016-09-14 Version 0.4.4\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Remove paging URL validation, part of fix https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/1420\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nIn order to get paging fixes for impacted clients, you need this package and Autorest > 0.17.0 Nightly 20160913\n\n2016-09-01 Version 0.4.3\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Better exception message (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/1300)\n\n2016-08-15 Version 0.4.2\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix serialization if \"object\" type contains None (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/1353)\n\n2016-08-08 Version 0.4.1\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix compatibility issues with requests 2.11.0 (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/1337)\n- Allow url of ClientRequest to have parameters (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/1217)\n\n2016-05-25 Version 0.4.0\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis version has no bug fixes, but implements new features of Autorest:\n- Base64 url type\n- unixtime type\n- x-ms-enum modelAsString flag\n\n**Behaviour changes**\n\n- Add Platform information in UserAgent\n- Needs Autorest > 0.17.0 Nightly 20160525\n\n2016-04-26 Version 0.3.0\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Read only values are no longer in __init__ or sent to the server (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/959)\n- Useless kwarg removed\n\n**Behaviour changes**\n\n- Needs Autorest > 0.16.0 Nightly 20160426\n\n\n2016-03-25 Version 0.2.0\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Manage integer enum values (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/879)\n- Add missing application/json Accept HTTP header (https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/553)\n\n**Behaviour changes**\n\n- Needs Autorest > 0.16.0 Nightly 20160324\n\n\n2016-03-21 Version 0.1.3\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Deserialisation of generic resource if null in JSON (https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/544)\n\n\n2016-03-14 Version 0.1.2\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- urllib3 side effect (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/824)\n\n\n2016-03-04 Version 0.1.1\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Source package corrupted in Pypi (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/799)\n\n2016-03-04 Version 0.1.0\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Behavioural Changes**\n\n- Removed custom logging set up and configuration.

Luckily,\nrequests_oauthlib hides most of these and let you focus at the task at hand.\n\nAccessing protected resources using requests_oauthlib is as simple as:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1Session\n    >>> twitter = OAuth1Session('client_key',\n                                client_secret='client_secret',\n                                resource_owner_key='resource_owner_key',\n                                resource_owner_secret='resource_owner_secret')\n    >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1/account/settings.json'\n    >>> r = twitter.get(url)\n\nBefore accessing resources you will need to obtain a few credentials from your\nprovider (e.g. Twitter) and authorization from the user for whom you wish to\nretrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the full\n`OAuth 1 workflow guide on RTD <https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth1_workflow.html>`_.\n\nThe OAuth 2 workflow\n--------------------\n\nOAuth 2 is generally simpler than OAuth 1 but comes in more flavours. The most\ncommon being the Authorization Code Grant, also known as the WebApplication\nflow.\n\nFetching a protected resource after obtaining an access token can be extremely\nsimple. However, before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few\ncredentials from your provider (e.g. Google) and authorization from the user\nfor whom you wish to retrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the\nfull `OAuth 2 workflow guide on RTD <https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html>`_.\n\nInstallation\n-------------\n\nTo install requests and requests_oauthlib you can use pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install requests requests_oauthlib\n\n.. |build-status| image:: https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/actions\n.. |coverage-status| image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/requests/requests-oauthlib.svg\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/requests/requests-oauthlib\n.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/requests-oauthlib/badge/\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n   :scale: 100%\n   :target: https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nv1.3.1 (21 January 2022)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Add initial support for OAuth Mutual TLS (draft-ietf-oauth-mtls)\n- Add eBay compliance fix\n- Add Spotify OAuth 2 Tutorial\n- Add support for python 3.8, 3.9\n- Fixed LinkedIn Compliance Fixes\n- Fixed ReadTheDocs Documentation and sphinx errors\n- Moved pipeline to GitHub Actions\n\nv1.3.0 (6 November 2019)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Instagram compliance fix\n- Added ``force_querystring`` argument to fetch_token() method on OAuth2Session\n\nv1.2.0 (14 January 2019)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- This project now depends on OAuthlib 3.0.0 and above. It does **not** support\n  versions of OAuthlib before 3.0.0.\n- Updated oauth2 tests to use 'sess' for an OAuth2Session instance instead of `auth`\n  because OAuth2Session objects and methods acceept an `auth` paramether which is\n  typically an instance of `requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth`\n- `OAuth2Session.fetch_token` previously tried to guess how and where to provide\n  \"client\" and \"user\" credentials incorrectly. This was incompatible with some\n  OAuth servers and incompatible with breaking changes in oauthlib that seek to\n  correctly provide the `client_id`. The older implementation also did not raise\n  the correct exceptions when username and password are not present on Legacy\n  clients.\n- Avoid automatic netrc authentication for OAuth2Session.\n\nv1.1.0 (9 January 2019)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Adjusted version specifier for ``oauthlib`` dependency: this project is\n  not yet compatible with ``oauthlib`` 3.0.0.\n- Dropped dependency on ``nose``.\n- Minor changes to clean up the code and make it more readable/maintainable.\n\nv1.0.0 (4 June 2018)\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- **Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3.**\n  This project now supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.4 and above.\n- Added several examples to the documentation.\n- Added plentymarkets compliance fix.\n- Added a ``token`` property to OAuth1Session, to match the corresponding\n  ``token`` property on OAuth2Session.\n\nv0.8.0 (14 February 2017)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added Fitbit compliance fix.\n- Fixed an issue where newlines in the response body for the access token\n  request would cause errors when trying to extract the token.\n- Fixed an issue introduced in v0.7.0 where users passing ``auth`` to several\n  methods would encounter conflicts with the ``client_id`` and\n  ``client_secret``-derived auth. The user-supplied ``auth`` argument is now\n  used in preference to those options.\n\nv0.7.0 (22 September 2016)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Allowed ``OAuth2Session.request`` to take the ``client_id`` and\n  ``client_secret`` parameters for the purposes of automatic token refresh,\n  which may need them.\n\nv0.6.2 (12 July 2016)\n+++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Use ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` for the Authorization header if\n  provided.\n- Allow explicit bypass of the Authorization header by setting ``auth=False``.\n- Pass through the ``proxies`` kwarg when refreshing tokens.\n- Miscellaneous cleanups.\n\nv0.6.1 (19 February 2016)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Fixed a bug when sending authorization in headers with no username and\n  password present.\n- Make sure we clear the session token before obtaining a new one.\n- Some improvements to the Slack compliance fix.\n- Avoid timing problems around token refresh.\n- Allow passing arbitrary arguments to requests when calling\n  ``fetch_request_token`` and ``fetch_access_token``.\n\nv0.6.0 (14 December 2015)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Add compliance fix for Slack.\n- Add compliance fix for Mailchimp.\n- ``TokenRequestDenied`` exceptions now carry the entire response, not just the\n  status code.\n- Pass through keyword arguments when refreshing tokens automatically.\n- Send authorization in headers, not just body, to maximize compatibility.\n- More getters/setters available for OAuth2 session client values.\n- Allow sending custom headers when refreshing tokens, and set some defaults.\n\n\nv0.5.0 (4 May 2015)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n- Fix ``TypeError`` being raised instead of ``TokenMissing`` error.\n- Raise requests exceptions on 4XX and 5XX responses in the OAuth2 flow.\n- Avoid ``AttributeError`` when initializing the ``OAuth2Session`` class\n  without complete client information.\n\nv0.4.2 (16 October 2014)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n- New ``authorized`` property on OAuth1Session and OAuth2Session, which allows\n  you to easily determine if the session is already authorized with OAuth tokens\n  or not.\n- New ``TokenMissing`` and ``VerifierMissing`` exception classes for OAuth1Session:\n  this will make it easier to catch and identify these exceptions.\n\nv0.4.1 (6 June 2014)\n++++++++++++++++++++\n- New install target ``[rsa]`` for people using OAuth1 RSA-SHA1 signature\n  method.\n- Fixed bug in OAuth2 where supplied state param was not used in auth url.\n- OAuth2 HTTPS checking can be disabled by setting environment variable\n  ``OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT``.\n- OAuth1 now re-authorize upon redirects.\n- OAuth1 token fetching now raise a detailed error message when the\n  response body is incorrectly encoded or the request was denied.\n- Added support for custom OAuth1 clients.\n- OAuth2 compliance fix for Sina Weibo.\n- Multiple fixes to facebook compliance fix.\n- Compliance fixes now re-encode body properly as bytes in Python 3.\n- Logging now properly done under ``requests_oauthlib`` namespace instead\n  of piggybacking on oauthlib namespace.\n- Logging introduced for OAuth1 auth and session.\n\nv0.4.0 (29 September 2013)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n- OAuth1Session methods only return unicode strings. #55.\n- Renamed requests_oauthlib.core to requests_oauthlib.oauth1_auth for consistency. #79.\n- Added Facebook compliance fix and access_token_response hook to OAuth2Session. #63.\n- Added LinkedIn compliance fix.\n- Added refresh_token_response compliance hook, invoked before parsing the refresh token.\n- Correctly limit compliance hooks to running only once!\n- Content type guessing should only be done when no content type is given\n- OAuth1 now updates r.headers instead of replacing it with non case insensitive dict\n- Remove last use of Response.content (in OAuth1Session). #44.\n- State param can now be supplied in OAuth2Session.authorize_url",

      "description": "Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python 3.7+\n# Typing Extensions\n\n[![Chat at https://gitter.im/python/typing](https://badges.gitter.im/python/typing.svg)](https://gitter.im/python/typing)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `typing_extensions` module serves two related purposes:\n\n- Enable use of new type system features on older Python versions. For example,\n  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows\n  users on previous Python versions to use it too.\n- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and\n  added to the `typing` module.\n\nNew features may be added to `typing_extensions` as soon as they are specified\nin a PEP that has been added to the [python/peps](https://github.com/python/peps)\nrepository. If the PEP is accepted, the feature will then be added to `typing`\nfor the next CPython release.

For example,\n  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows\n  users on previous Python versions to use it too.\n- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and\n  added to the `typing` module.\n\nNew features may be added to `typing_extensions` as soon as they are specified\nin a PEP that has been added to the [python/peps](https://github.com/python/peps)\nrepository. If the PEP is accepted, the feature will then be added to `typing`\nfor the next CPython release. No typing PEP has been rejected so far, so we\nhaven't yet figured out how to deal with that possibility.\n\nStarting with version 4.0.0, `typing_extensions` uses\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Users who are using urllib3 version 1.17 or 1.18 along with\n  PyOpenSSL injection and OpenSSL 1.1.0 *must* upgrade to this version. This\n  release fixes a vulnerability whereby urllib3 in the above configuration\n  would silently fail to validate TLS certificates due to erroneously setting\n  invalid flags in OpenSSL's ``SSL_CTX_set_verify`` function. These erroneous\n  flags do not cause a problem in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0, which\n  interprets the presence of any flag as requesting certificate validation.\n\n  There is no PR for this patch, as it was prepared for simultaneous disclosure\n  and release. The master branch received the same fix in Pull #1010.\n\n\n1.18 (2016-09-26)\n-----------------\n\n* Fixed incorrect message for IncompleteRead exception.

(Issue #848)\n\n* Timeout can no longer be set as boolean, and must be greater than zero.\n  (Pull #924)\n\n* Removed pyasn1 and ndg-httpsclient from dependencies used for PyOpenSSL. We\n  now use cryptography and idna, both of which are already dependencies of\n  PyOpenSSL. (Pull #930)\n\n* Fixed infinite loop in ``stream`` when amt=None. (Issue #928)\n\n* Try to use the operating system's certificates when we are using an\n  ``SSLContext``. (Pull #941)\n\n* Updated cipher suite list to allow ChaCha20+Poly1305.

Also changed constructor\n  signature to a more sensible order. [Backwards incompatible]\n  (Issues #252, #262, #263)\n\n* Use ``backports.ssl_match_hostname`` if it's installed. (Issue #274)\n\n* Added ``.tell()`` method to ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` which\n  returns the number of bytes read so far. (Issue #277)\n\n* Support for platforms without threading. (Issue #289)\n\n* Expand default-port comparison in ``HTTPConnectionPool.is_same_host``\n  to allow a pool with no specified port to be considered equal to to an\n  HTTP/HTTPS url with port 80/443 explicitly provided. (Issue #305)\n\n* Improved default SSL/TLS settings to avoid vulnerabilities.\n  (Issue #309)\n\n* Fixed ``urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager`` not retrying on connect errors.\n  (Issue #310)\n\n* Disable Nagle's Algorithm on the socket for non-proxies. A subset of requests\n  will send the entire HTTP request ~200 milliseconds faster; however, some of\n  the resulting TCP packets will be smaller. (Issue #254)\n\n* Increased maximum number of SubjectAltNames in ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl``\n  from the default 64 to 1024 in a single certificate. (Issue #318)\n\n* Headers are now passed and stored as a custom\n  ``urllib3.collections_.HTTPHeaderDict`` object rather than a plain ``dict``.\n  (Issue #329, #333)\n\n* Headers no longer lose their case on Python 3. (Issue #236)\n\n* ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` now uses the operating system's default CA\n  certificates on inject.

(Issue #178)\n\n* Support for relative urls in ``Location: ...`` header. (Issue #179)\n\n* ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` now inherits from ``io.IOBase`` for bonus\n  file-like functionality. (Issue #187)\n\n* Passing ``assert_hostname=False`` when creating a HTTPSConnectionPool will\n  skip hostname verification for SSL connections. (Issue #194)\n\n* New method ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.stream(...)`` which acts as a\n  generator wrapped around ``.read(...)``. (Issue #198)\n\n* IPv6 url parsing enforces brackets around the hostname. (Issue #199)\n\n* Fixed thread race condition in\n  ``urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager.connection_from_host(...)`` (Issue #204)\n\n* ``ProxyManager`` requests now include non-default port in ``Host: ...``\n  header.

(Issue #119)\n\n* Improved IPv6 support. (Issue #203)\n\n\n1.6 (2013-04-25)\n----------------\n\n* Contrib: Optional SNI support for Py2 using PyOpenSSL. (Issue #156)\n\n* ``ProxyManager`` automatically adds ``Host: ...`` header if not given.\n\n* Improved SSL-related code. ``cert_req`` now optionally takes a string like\n  \"REQUIRED\" or \"NONE\". Same with ``ssl_version`` takes strings like \"SSLv23\"\n  The string values reflect the suffix of the respective constant variable.\n  (Issue #130)\n\n* Vendored ``socksipy`` now based on Anorov's fork which handles unexpectedly\n  closed proxy connections and larger read buffers. (Issue #135)\n\n* Ensure the connection is closed if no data is received, fixes connection leak\n  on some platforms. (Issue #133)\n\n* Added SNI support for SSL/TLS connections on Py32+. (Issue #89)\n\n* Tests fixed to be compatible with Py26 again. (Issue #125)\n\n* Added ability to choose SSL version by passing an ``ssl.PROTOCOL_*`` constant\n  to the ``ssl_version`` parameter of ``HTTPSConnectionPool``. (Issue #109)\n\n* Allow an explicit content type to be specified when encoding file fields.\n  (Issue #126)\n\n* Exceptions are now pickleable, with tests. (Issue #101)\n\n* Fixed default headers not getting passed in some cases. (Issue #99)\n\n* Treat \"content-encoding\" header value as case-insensitive, per RFC 2616\n  Section 3.5. (Issue #110)\n\n* \"Connection Refused\" SocketErrors will get retried rather than raised.\n  (Issue #92)\n\n* Updated vendored ``six``, no longer overrides the global ``six`` module\n  namespace. (Issue #113)\n\n* ``urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError`` contains a ``reason`` property holding\n  the exception that prompted the final retry. If ``reason is None`` then it\n  was due to a redirect. (Issue #92, #114)\n\n* Fixed ``PoolManager.urlopen()`` from not redirecting more than once.\n  (Issue #149)\n\n* Don't assume ``Content-Type: text/plain`` for multi-part encoding parameters\n  that are not files. (Issue #111)\n\n* Pass `strict` param down to ``httplib.HTTPConnection``. (Issue #122)\n\n* Added mechanism to verify SSL certificates by fingerprint (md5, sha1) or\n  against an arbitrary hostname (when connecting by IP or for misconfigured\n  servers). (Issue #140)\n\n* Streaming decompression support. (Issue #159)\n\n\n1.5 (2012-08-02)\n----------------\n\n* Added ``urllib3.add_stderr_logger()`` for quickly enabling STDERR debug\n  logging in urllib3.\n\n* Native full URL parsing (including auth, path, query, fragment) available in\n  ``urllib3.util.parse_url(url)``.\n\n* Built-in redirect will switch method to 'GET' if status code is 303.\n  (Issue #11)\n\n* ``urllib3.PoolManager`` strips the scheme and host before sending the request\n  uri. (Issue #8)\n\n* New ``urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`` exception for when automatic decoding,\n  based on the Content-Type header, fails.\n\n* Fixed bug with pool depletion and leaking connections (Issue #76). Added\n  explicit connection closing on pool eviction. Added\n  ``urllib3.PoolManager.clear()``.\n\n* 99% -> 100% unit test coverage.\n\n\n1.4 (2012-06-16)\n----------------\n\n* Minor AppEngine-related fixes.\n\n* Switched from ``mimetools.choose_boundary`` to ``uuid.uuid4()``.\n\n* Improved url parsing.

(Thanks @christer)\n\n* Made RecentlyUsedContainer more dict-like (corrected ``__delitem__`` and\n  ``__getitem__`` behaviour), with tests. Shouldn't affect core urllib3 code.\n\n\n1.0.1 (2011-10-10)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed a bug where the same connection would get returned into the pool twice,\n  causing extraneous \"HttpConnectionPool is full\" log warnings.\n\n\n1.0 (2011-10-08)\n----------------\n\n* Added ``PoolManager`` with LRU expiration of connections (tested and\n  documented).\n* Added ``ProxyManager`` (needs tests, docs, and confirmation that it works\n  with HTTPS proxies).\n* Added optional partial-read support for responses when\n  ``preload_content=False``. You can now make requests and just read the headers\n  without loading the content.\n* Made response decoding optional (default on, same as before).\n* Added optional explicit boundary string for ``encode_multipart_formdata``.\n* Convenience request methods are now inherited from ``RequestMethods``.

(Pull #1025)\n\n\n1.19 (2016-11-03)\n-----------------\n\n* urllib3 now respects Retry-After headers on 413, 429, and 503 responses when\n  using the default retry logic. (Pull #955)\n\n* Remove markers from setup.py to assist ancient setuptools versions. (Issue\n  #986)\n\n* Disallow superscripts and other integerish things in URL ports. (Issue #989)\n\n* Allow urllib3's HTTPResponse.stream() method to continue to work with\n  non-httplib underlying FPs.

(Issue #1009)\n\n\n1.18.1 (2016-10-27)\n-------------------\n\n* CVE-2016-9015. Users who are using urllib3 version 1.17 or 1.18 along with\n  PyOpenSSL injection and OpenSSL 1.1.0 *must* upgrade to this version. This\n  release fixes a vulnerability whereby urllib3 in the above configuration\n  would silently fail to validate TLS certificates due to erroneously setting\n  invalid flags in OpenSSL's ``SSL_CTX_set_verify`` function. These erroneous\n  flags do not cause a problem in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0, which\n  interprets the presence of any flag as requesting certificate validation.\n\n  There is no PR for this patch, as it was prepared for simultaneous disclosure\n  and release. The master branch received the same fix in Pull #1010.\n\n\n1.18 (2016-09-26)\n-----------------\n\n* Fixed incorrect message for IncompleteRead exception.

(Issue #887)\n\n* Used URLFetch default timeout on AppEngine, rather than hardcoding our own.\n  (Issue #858)\n\n* Normalize the scheme and host in the URL parser (Issue #833)\n\n* ``HTTPResponse`` contains the last ``Retry`` object, which now also\n  contains retries history. (Issue #848)\n\n* Timeout can no longer be set as boolean, and must be greater than zero.\n  (Pull #924)\n\n* Removed pyasn1 and ndg-httpsclient from dependencies used for PyOpenSSL. We\n  now use cryptography and idna, both of which are already dependencies of\n  PyOpenSSL. (Pull #930)\n\n* Fixed infinite loop in ``stream`` when amt=None. (Issue #928)\n\n* Try to use the operating system's certificates when we are using an\n  ``SSLContext``. (Pull #941)\n\n* Updated cipher suite list to allow ChaCha20+Poly1305. AES-GCM is preferred to\n  ChaCha20, but ChaCha20 is then preferred to everything else. (Pull #947)\n\n* Updated cipher suite list to remove 3DES-based cipher suites. (Pull #958)\n\n* Removed the cipher suite fallback to allow HIGH ciphers. (Pull #958)\n\n* Implemented ``length_remaining`` to determine remaining content\n  to be read. (Pull #949)\n\n* Implemented ``enforce_content_length`` to enable exceptions when\n  incomplete data chunks are received. (Pull #949)\n\n* Dropped connection start, dropped connection reset, redirect, forced retry,\n  and new HTTPS connection log levels to DEBUG, from INFO. (Pull #967)\n\n\n1.16 (2016-06-11)\n-----------------\n\n* Disable IPv6 DNS when IPv6 connections are not possible. (Issue #840)\n\n* Provide ``key_fn_by_scheme`` pool keying mechanism that can be\n  overridden.

(Issue #830)\n\n* Cleaner exception chain in Python 3 for ``_make_request``.\n  (Issue #861)\n\n* Fixed installing ``urllib3[socks]`` extra. (Issue #864)\n\n* Fixed signature of ``ConnectionPool.close`` so it can actually safely be\n  called by subclasses. (Issue #873)\n\n* Retain ``release_conn`` state across retries. (Issues #651, #866)\n\n* Add customizable ``HTTPConnectionPool.ResponseCls``, which defaults to\n  ``HTTPResponse`` but can be replaced with a subclass. (Issue #879)\n\n\n1.15.1 (2016-04-11)\n-------------------\n\n* Fix packaging to include backports module. (Issue #841)\n\n\n1.15 (2016-04-06)\n-----------------\n\n* Added Retry(raise_on_status=False). (Issue #720)\n\n* Always use setuptools, no more distutils fallback.

(Issue #274)\n\n* Added ``.tell()`` method to ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` which\n  returns the number of bytes read so far. (Issue #277)\n\n* Support for platforms without threading. (Issue #289)\n\n* Expand default-port comparison in ``HTTPConnectionPool.is_same_host``\n  to allow a pool with no specified port to be considered equal to to an\n  HTTP/HTTPS url with port 80/443 explicitly provided. (Issue #305)\n\n* Improved default SSL/TLS settings to avoid vulnerabilities.\n  (Issue #309)\n\n* Fixed ``urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager`` not retrying on connect errors.\n  (Issue #310)\n\n* Disable Nagle's Algorithm on the socket for non-proxies. A subset of requests\n  will send the entire HTTP request ~200 milliseconds faster; however, some of\n  the resulting TCP packets will be smaller. (Issue #254)\n\n* Increased maximum number of SubjectAltNames in ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl``\n  from the default 64 to 1024 in a single certificate. (Issue #318)\n\n* Headers are now passed and stored as a custom\n  ``urllib3.collections_.HTTPHeaderDict`` object rather than a plain ``dict``.\n  (Issue #329, #333)\n\n* Headers no longer lose their case on Python 3. (Issue #236)\n\n* ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` now uses the operating system's default CA\n  certificates on inject.

(Issue #156)\n\n* ``ProxyManager`` automatically adds ``Host: ...`` header if not given.\n\n* Improved SSL-related code. ``cert_req`` now optionally takes a string like\n  \"REQUIRED\" or \"NONE\". Same with ``ssl_version`` takes strings like \"SSLv23\"\n  The string values reflect the suffix of the respective constant variable.\n  (Issue #130)\n\n* Vendored ``socksipy`` now based on Anorov's fork which handles unexpectedly\n  closed proxy connections and larger read buffers. (Issue #135)\n\n* Ensure the connection is closed if no data is received, fixes connection leak\n  on some platforms. (Issue #133)\n\n* Added SNI support for SSL/TLS connections on Py32+.

(Issue #113)\n\n* ``urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError`` contains a ``reason`` property holding\n  the exception that prompted the final retry. If ``reason is None`` then it\n  was due to a redirect. (Issue #92, #114)\n\n* Fixed ``PoolManager.urlopen()`` from not redirecting more than once.\n  (Issue #149)\n\n* Don't assume ``Content-Type: text/plain`` for multi-part encoding parameters\n  that are not files. (Issue #111)\n\n* Pass `strict` param down to ``httplib.HTTPConnection``. (Issue #122)\n\n* Added mechanism to verify SSL certificates by fingerprint (md5, sha1) or\n  against an arbitrary hostname (when connecting by IP or for misconfigured\n  servers). (Issue #140)\n\n* Streaming decompression support.
